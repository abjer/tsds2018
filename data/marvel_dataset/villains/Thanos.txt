'''Thanos''' ({{IPAc-en|UK|ˈ|θ|æ|n|ɒ|s}}, {{IPAc-en|US|ˈ|θ|æ|n|oʊ|s}}) is a fictional antagonist appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Created by writer [[Mike Friedrich]] and writer-artist [[Jim Starlin]], the character first appeared in ''[[Iron Man]]'' #55 ([[cover date]]d Feb. 1973).

The character appears in various [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] films, including ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' (2012), portrayed by [[Damion Poitier]], and ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' (2014), ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]'' (2015), ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'' (2018), and [[Untitled Avengers film|its untitled sequel]] (2019), portrayed by [[Josh Brolin]]. The character has appeared in other Marvel-endorsed products, including [[Animation|animated]] television series, [[Arcade game|arcade]], and video games.

==Origin==
Writer-artist [[Jim Starlin]] originally conceived of Thanos of Titan during college [[psychology]] classes. As Starlin described:

{{quote|I went to college between doing [[U.S. military]] service and getting work in comics, and there was a psych class and I came up with Thanos&nbsp;... and [[Drax the Destroyer]], but I'm not sure how he fit into it, just [[anger management]] probably. So I came up to Marvel and [editor] [[Roy Thomas|Roy]] [Thomas] asked if I wanted to do an issue of ''[[Iron Man]]''. I felt that this may be my only chance ever to do a character, not having the confidence that my career was going to last anything longer than a few weeks. So they got jammed into it. Thanos was a much thinner character and Roy suggested beefing him up, so he's beefed up quite a bit from his original sketches&nbsp;... and later on I liked beefing him up so much that he continued to grow in size.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080122032717/http://www.adelaidecomicsandbooks.com/starlin.htm "Jim Starlin"]. Adelaid Comics and Books. Archived via the [[Wayback Machine]]. Retrieved March 25, 2014.</ref>}}

Starlin has admitted the character is influenced by [[Jack Kirby]]'s [[Darkseid]]:

{{quote|Kirby had done the [[New Gods]], which I thought was terrific. He was over at [[DC Comics|DC]] at the time. I came up with some things that were inspired by that. You'd think that Thanos was inspired by Darkseid, but that was not the case when I showed up. In my first Thanos drawings, if he looked like anybody, it was [[Metron (comics)|Metron]]. I had all these different gods and things I wanted to do, which became Thanos and the Titans. Roy took one look at the guy in the Metron-like chair and said: "Beef him up! If you're going to steal one of the New Gods, at least rip off Darkseid, the really good one!"<ref>{{Cite web |first=Brian |last=Cronin |url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2010/06/24/comic-book-legends-revealed-266/ |title=Comic Book Legends Revealed #266 |work=[[Comic Book Resources]] |date=2010-06-24 |accessdate=2010-06-24}}</ref>}}

==Fictional character biography==

Thanos was born on [[Saturn]]'s moon [[Titan (Marvel Comics)|Titan]], and is the child of [[Eternals (comics)|Eternals]] [[Mentor (A'lars)|Mentor]] and [[Sui-San]]. Thanos carries the [[Deviant (comics)|Deviants]] gene, and as such shares the physical appearance of the Eternals' cousin race. At birth, his mother was shocked by his appearance and attempted to kill him. During his school years, Thanos was a [[pacifist]]<ref>''Thanos Rising'' #1</ref> and would only play with his brother [[Starfox (comics)|Eros]] (Starfox) and pets. By adolescence, Thanos had become fascinated with [[nihilism]] and death, worshipping and eventually falling in love with the physical embodiment of death, [[Death (Marvel Comics)|Mistress Death]].<ref>''Thanos Rising'' #3, ''Iron Man'' vol 1 #55</ref> As an adult, Thanos augmented his physical strength and powers mystically and artificially. He also attempted to create a new life for himself by starting a family. He is visited again by Mistress Death, for whom he murders his family.<ref>''Thanos Rising'' #4-5</ref>

===Cosmic Cube and Infinity Gems===

Wishing to impress Mistress Death, Thanos gathers an army of villainous aliens and begins a nuclear bombardment of Titan that kills millions of his race.<ref name="AvengersAnnual7">''Avengers Annual'' #7 (1977)</ref> Seeking universal power in the form of the [[Cosmic Cube]], Thanos travels to Earth. Prior to landing, his vessel destroys a nearby car  as a family witnesses his arrival.<ref>''Captain Marvel'' #30 (Jan. 1974)</ref> Unbeknownst to Thanos, two of the family members in the vehicle survive: the father's spirit is preserved by the Titanian cosmic entity [[Kronos (comics)|Kronos]] and is given a new form as [[Drax the Destroyer]] while the daughter is found by Thanos' father, Mentor, and is raised to become the heroine [[Moondragon]]. Thanos eventually locates the Cube, and also attracts the attention of Mistress Death. Willing the Cube to make him omnipotent, Thanos then discards the Cube. He imprisons Kronos and taunts [[Kree]] hero Captain Marvel, who with the aid of superhero team the Avengers and [[ISAAC (comics)|ISAAC]] (a super-computer based on Titan), is eventually able to defeat Thanos by destroying the Cube.<ref>''Captain Marvel'' #33 (July 1974)</ref>

Thanos later comes to the aid of [[Adam Warlock]] in a war against the [[Magus (comics)|Magus]] and his religious empire.<ref>''Strange Tales'' #178-181 (Feb.–Aug. 1975)</ref><ref>''Warlock'' #9–11 (Oct. 1975&nbsp;– Jan. 1976)</ref> During this alliance Thanos cultivates a plan to reunite with Mistress Death, and secretly siphons off the energies of Warlock's Soul Gem, and combines these with the power of the other Infinity Gems to create a weapon capable of destroying a star. Warlock summons the Avengers and Captain Marvel to stop Thanos, although the plan is foiled when Thanos kills Warlock. The Titan regroups and captures the heroes, who are freed by Spider-Man and the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]]. Thanos is finally stopped by Warlock, whose spirit emerges from the Soul Gem and turns the Titan to stone.<ref name="AvengersAnnual7"/><ref>''Marvel Two-in-One Annual'' #2 (1977)</ref> Thanos's spirit eventually reappears to accompany a dying Captain Marvel's soul into the realm of Death.<ref>''Death of Captain Marvel'' (1982)</ref>

===The Infinity saga===
Thanos is eventually resurrected,<ref>''[[Silver Surfer]]'' vol. 3, #34 (Feb. 1990)</ref> and collects the Infinity Gems once again.<ref>''[[The Thanos Quest]]'' (1990)</ref> He uses the gems to create the Infinity Gauntlet, making himself omnipotent, and erases half the living things in the universe to prove his love to Death.<ref>''The Infinity Gauntlet'' #1 (July 1991)</ref> This act and several other acts are soon undone by Adam Warlock.<ref>''The Infinity Gauntlet'' #6 (Dec. 1991)</ref> Warlock reveals that Thanos has always allowed himself to be defeated because the Titan secretly knows he is not worthy of ultimate power. Thanos joins Warlock as part of the [[Infinity Watch]] and helps him to defeat first his [[Magus (comics)|evil]]<ref>''The Infinity War'' #1–6 (1992)</ref> and then [[Goddess (comics)|good]]<ref>''The Infinity Crusade'' #1–6 (1993)</ref> personas, and cure  [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] of "warrior Madness".<ref>''Thor'' #470–471 (Jan.–Feb. 1994); ''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3, #88 (Jan. 1994); ''Warlock Chronicles'' #8 (Feb. 1994); ''Warlock and the Infinity Watch'' #25 (Feb. 1994)</ref>

The events above have been dubbed the "Infinity saga."<ref>''[https://books.google.com/books?id=fPCSBgAAQBAJ&vq= Infinity Gauntlet: Aftermath]'', Marvel, 2013, back cover.</ref>

===Other adventures===
Thanos later recruits a team of Earth-bound super-villains and puts them under the field leadership of [[Geatar]] in a mission to capture an ancient robot containing the obscure knowledge of a universal library and extract its data.<ref>''Secret Defenders'' #11–14 (Jan.–April 1994)</ref> Thanos uses information from the robot to plot against and battle [[Tyrant (Marvel Comics)|Tyrant]], the first creation of Galactus turned destroyer.<ref>''Cosmic Powers'' #1–6 (March–Aug. 1994)</ref> When trapped in an alternate dimension, Thanos employs the aid of the brother of [[Ka-Zar (comics)|Ka-Zar]], [[Plunderer|Parnival Plunder]]<ref>''Ka-Zar'' vol. 2, #4–11 (Aug 1997&nbsp;– March 1998), ''Annual 1997''</ref> and later the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]]<ref>''X-Man and Hulk Annual 1998''</ref> to escape, although both attempts are unsuccessful. Thanos is eventually freed and comes into conflict with Thor, aligning himself with [[Mangog]] in a scheme to obtain powerful mystical and cosmic talismans which will allow him to destroy all life in the universe,<ref>''Thor'' vol. 2, #21-25 (March–July 2000)</ref> and during their battles Thanos decimates the planet [[Rigellians (comics)|Rigel-3]].<ref>''Thor Annual'' (2000)</ref>

Thanos then uses the heroes Thor and [[Genis-Vell]] (Captain Marvel's son) against the death god Walker, who attempts to woo Mistress Death and then destroy the entity after being rejected.<ref>''Captain Marvel'' vol. 2, #17–19 (June–Aug. 2001)</ref> Thanos then devises a plan to become the All-Father of a new pantheon of gods created by himself. Thanos, however, finds himself opposed by the Avengers' former member [[Mantis (Marvel Comics)|Mantis]] and her son Quoi, who apparently is destined to be the Celestial Messiah. Thanos abandons this plan after having to unite with Mistress Death to destroy the "Rot", a cosmic aberration in deep space caused by Thanos's incessant love for Death.<ref>''Avengers: Celestial Quest'' #1–8 (Nov. 2001&nbsp;– June 2002)</ref> Thanos also once conducted extensive research on genetics, and after studying many of the universe's heroes and villains [[Cloning|cloned]] them and gene-spliced his own [[DNA]] into the subjects. Although he later abandons the project, five clones survive, being versions of [[Professor X]], Iron Man, [[Gladiator (Kallark)|Gladiator]], [[Doctor Strange]], and Galactus respectively. A sixth and unnamed version of Thanos also appears, and it is revealed the incarnations of Thanos encountered in the past by Thor and Ka-Zar were actually clones. The true Thanos&nbsp;– with the aid of Adam Warlock, Gamora, Pip the Troll, Spider-Man, Captain Marvel, and Dr. Strange&nbsp;– destroys the remaining clones.<ref>''The Infinity Abyss'' #1–6 (2002)</ref>

When the ancient Egyptian [[pharaoh]] Akhenaten uses a [[Heart of the Universe|source of cosmic power]], the Heart of the Universe, to seize power in present-day Earth (killing most of Earth's heroes in the process), Thanos uses a time-travel stratagem to defeat him. Thanos then uses the Heart of the Universe to reverse Akhenaten's actions and was also compelled to correct a flaw in the universe. Changed by the experience, Thanos advises confidant Adam Warlock he will no longer seek universal conquest.<ref>''Marvel: The End'' #1-6 (May-Aug. 2003)</ref> However, Marvel's Executive Editor [[Tom Brevoort]] has stated on his [[Tumblr]] blog that this story is not in any way a part of official Marvel continuity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://brevoortformspring.tumblr.com/post/94063615333/so-despite-everyone-else-believing-the-end-was|title=New Brevoort Formspring|work=tumblr.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://brevoortformspring.tumblr.com/post/107750758608/wait-a-second-wait-a-second-i-just-saw-on|title=New Brevoort Formspring|work=tumblr.com}}</ref>

Thanos decides to atone for the destruction of Rigel-3, and agrees to aid a colony of Rigellians in evacuating their planet before Galactus can consume it. During the course of this mission Thanos learns Galactus is collecting the Infinity Gems in an effort to end his unyielding hunger. Thanos later learns Galactus is being manipulated into releasing a multiversal threat called Hunger, which feeds on entire universes. Despite opposition from Thanos, Galactus unwittingly frees the entity, and when its intentions are revealed, the pair team up and attempt to destroy it.<ref>''Thanos'' #1–6(Dec. 2003&nbsp;– April 2004)</ref>

En route to the [[Kyln]], an intergalactic prison, Thanos meets Death, who for the first time speaks to the Titan. Death claims to be worth wooing, but says Thanos must offer something other than death. At the Kyln Thanos encounters Peter Quill, also known as [[Star-Lord]], and the [[Shi'ar]] warrior [[Gladiator (Kallark)|Gladiator]], who are both prisoners, and the [[Beyonder]], who has been rendered amnesiac by its choice to assume a humanoid female form. Thanos battles the Beyonder, causing its mind to shut down and leaving its power trapped within a comatose physical form. Thanos then instructs the Kyln officers to keep the Beyonder on life support indefinitely in order to prevent the entity from being reborn.<ref>''Thanos'' #7–9 (May 2004)</ref> Thanos departs the Kyln in the company of Skreet, a chaos-mite freed from the prison. Thanos then meets the Fallen, revealed to be the true first [[Herald of Galactus]]. Thanos defeats the former Herald and places him under complete mental control.<ref>''Thanos'' #10-12 (July&nbsp;– Sept. 2004)</ref> He later appears in [[Wisconsin]] attempting to charge a weapon called the Pyramatrix with the life force of everyone on Earth until he is defeated by [[Squirrel Girl]]. After the battle, [[Uatu]] the Watcher appears and confirms to Squirrel Girl that she defeated the real Thanos, not a clone or copy.<ref>''GLX-Mas Special'' (December 2005)</ref>

===Annihilation===
{{Main article|Annihilation (comics)}}
During the [[Annihilation (comics)|Annihilation War]] Thanos allies himself with the genocidal villain [[Annihilus]]. When the Annihilation Wave destroys the Kyln, Thanos sends the Fallen to check on the status of the Beyonder, whose mortal form he finds has perished. Before the Fallen can report back to Thanos it encounters [[Tenebrous (Marvel Comics)|Tenebrous]] and [[Aegis (Lady of All Sorrows)|Aegis]]: two of [[Galactus]]'s ancient foes. Thanos convinces Tenebrous and Aegis to join the Annihilation Wave in order to get revenge on Galactus, and they subsequently defeat the World Devourer and the Silver Surfer. Annihilus desires the secret of the Power Cosmic and asks Thanos to study Galactus. Once Thanos learns Annihilus's true goal is to use the [[Power Cosmic]] to destroy all life and remain the sole survivor, he decides to free Galactus. Drax the Destroyer kills Thanos before he can do so but discovers that Thanos had placed a failsafe device to allow Silver Surfer to free Galactus in the event that Annihilus betrayed him.<ref>''Annihilation'' #4 (Jan. 2007)</ref> During a climactic battle with Annihilus, [[Nova (Richard Rider)|Nova]] is near death and sees Thanos standing with Mistress Death.<ref>''Annihilation'' #6 (March 2007)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Thanos is a mutant member of the race of superhumans known as the [[Titan (Marvel Comics)|Titan]]ian Eternals. The character possesses abilities common to the Eternals, but amplified to a higher degree through a combination of his mutant–Eternal heritage, bionic amplification, mysticism, and power bestowed by the abstract entity, Death. Demonstrating enormous superhuman strength, stamina, and durability, Thanos can absorb and project vast quantities of cosmic energy and is capable of [[telekinesis]], [[telepathy]], and matter manipulation. Thanos is an accomplished hand-to-hand combatant, having been trained in the art of war on Titan.

Thanos has proven himself capable of briefly holding his own in battle against [[Odin (comics)|Odin]],<ref>''Warlock and the Infinity Watch'' #25 (Feb. 1994)</ref> and of blasting [[Galactus]] off his feet.<ref>''Thanos'' #5 (April 2004)</ref>

Thanos is a supergenius in virtually all known fields of advanced science and has created technology far exceeding contemporary Earth science. He often employs a transportation chair capable of space flight, [[force shield|force field]] projection, [[teleportation]], [[time travel]], and movement through [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]]s. Thanos is also a master strategist and uses several space vessels, at least three under the name "Sanctuary", as a base of operations.
