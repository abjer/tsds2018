'''Lt. Ethan Warren''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] [[supervillain]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] universe. He first appeared in the limited series Logan #1.

==Fictional character biography==
===World War II===
Lt. Ethan Warren was first shown in a flashback during WWII where he was a Prisoner of War in a Japanese cell with Logan ([[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]]). After Logan awoke, they both quickly escaped and headed into the woods. As they walked, they came across a woman who dropped her flowers upon seeing two westerners before her. Lt. Warren wanted to kill her, but Logan warned him that, if he shot her, he’d go the same way. The two men parted company, and Logan discovered that the woman had no intent to harm him. Later, Lt. Warren suddenly appears to Logan and Atsuko. He shoots Logan and prepares to rape Atsuko. However, Atsuko grabs a sword and attacks Warren hard, throwing her sword at him and then scratching his face. Warren still manages to get the better of her, and stabs her through the chest with his bayonet. As she drops to the ground, Logan gets up and attacks. Warren realizes that they are alike. They cannot be killed. Logan stabs him through the chest, but he recovers quickly, surprising Logan. Warren explains that he is a mutant. He can be drowned or poisoned or cut, but he cannot be killed. Logan does not believe him, but he finds himself unable to put Warren down. As they fight, they hear a plane approach. It delivers its small payload, and all hell breaks loose. After an attack he escapes.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

===After M-Day===
A mysterious opponent in Japan attacks Wolverine but, when he slashes at him, he realizes that it’s actually Lt. Warren. Logan tells him he does not want to have to kill him, but Warren responds by plunging his hand into Logan’s chest and removing his heart. Warren eats Logan’s heart, which causes his flaming body to revert to its natural, human form. He then grabs a coat and thanks Wolverine, but he is then astonished that, despite having his heart ripped out, Wolverine manages to stand up and come after him. Warren unleashes a searing blast at Logan, but this barely slows him down. Warren pleads for mercy, but Wolverine offers none. Wolverine then kills Warren before passing out.<ref>Vaughn & Russo, ''Logan'' #3, July, 2008.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Lt. Ethan Warren was a mutant with apparently similar powers to Wolverine, in the fact that he was almost invincible, able to survive a nuclear explosion, albeit being reduced to a flaming skeleton. However, he did not possess an accelerated healing factor, but was immune to pain. After his exposure to the nuclear explosion of Hiroshima, he gained energy projection abilities, and a degree of superhuman strength great enough to rip open Wolverine's chest. Due to his Training in the U.S. Army, he was also an excellent combat fighter.
