==Fictional character biography==
===Elihas Starr===
'''Elihas Starr''' was born in [[Queens, New York]]. A gifted government research atomic scientist with an egg-shaped head, Starr was dismissed for espionage and resolved to use his intellect as a criminal mastermind. He was dealt a humiliating initial defeat by [[Hank Pym|Ant-Man]] (Hank Pym) when he created a device to communicate with ants and tried to convince them to betray Ant-Man by leading him into a fly paper trap. Ant-Man tricked him into thinking the ants had betrayed him before revealing that the ants were his friends and would never turn against him.<ref>''Tales to Astonish'' #38</ref> Egghead later captured the Wasp to try luring Hank into a trap involving several creatures, including an iguana and an anteater, but this failed.<ref>''Tales to Astonish'' #45</ref> Egghead divided his remaining years between attempted world conquest and seeking revenge on Pym, often hiding out in the [[Bowery]] section of [[Manhattan]] in between.<ref name="mnyc">{{cite book | last = Sanderson | first = Peter | authorlink = | title = The Marvel Comics Guide to New York City | publisher = [[Pocket Books]] | year = 2007 | location = New York City | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 1-4165-3141-6 | page = 18}}</ref>

Egghead allied with the [[Mad Thinker]] and the [[Puppet Master (Marvel Comics)|Puppet Master]] in a plot to use a laser satellite to blackmail the United States government.<ref>''Avengers'' #63</ref> He caused the death of Barney Barton, brother of [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]], who was aiding the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]],<ref>''Avengers'' #64</ref> hired the [[Swordsman (comics)#Jacques Duquesne|Swordsman]] to kidnap Henry Pym, and battled Clint Barton who had recently adopted Pym's previous identity of [[Goliath (Marvel Comics)|Goliath]].<ref>''Avengers'' #65</ref>

Egghead later kidnapped his niece, Trish Starr, in order to test a device which allowed him to steal other people's intelligence, and wound up battling Henry Pym, as Ant-Man again.<ref>''Marvel Feature'' #5</ref> He would later cause her car to explode, causing her to lose an arm.<ref>''Giant Size Defenders'' #4</ref> He then formed the second [[Emissaries of Evil]] in an attempt to gain possession of the mystic artifact the Star of Capistan. This team consisted of himself, the [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]], [[Solarr]] and the [[Cobalt Man]]. Egghead and the Emissaries battled the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]].<ref>''Defenders'' #42-43</ref> Egghead also fought [[Spider-Man]] on different occasions.

Egghead was obsessed with Hank Pym, and engineered his disgrace. Egghead approached Pym, who was operating as Yellowjacket at the time, with a prosthetic arm that he wished to give to Trish in order make amends for his previous deeds. After the arm was installed, Egghead informed Pym that the arm contained a bomb that would be detonated unless Pym complied with Egghead's commands. Egghead had Pym attempt to rob a national treasury of [[adamantium]], and Pym was caught and arrested by the Avengers.<ref>''Avengers'' #217</ref> With Pym apparently out of the way, Egghead then formed the third [[Masters of Evil]] as part of a plot against the Avengers.<ref>''Avengers'' #222</ref>

Egghead then sent his Masters of Evil to kidnap Pym from his trial, making it appear as if Pym himself had staged his rescue. The attempt was successful, and Egghead instructed Pym to construct an anti-aging device. Subsequently, Pym goaded Egghead into letting him test the machine himself. However, the device turned out to be a weapon system, and he single-handedly defeated the assembled Masters. The Avengers arrived too late to be of assistance, but Hawkeye arrived at the laboratory in time to see the defeated Egghead about to shoot Hank in the back out of spite with his energy blaster. Hawkeye shot an arrow into Egghead's gun barrel. The gun misfired, causing an accidental explosion of the energy pistol which killed Egghead, ironically and inadvertently avenging the death of Hawkeye's brother at Egghead's hands years ago.<ref>''Avengers'' #228-229</ref>

[[Arnim Zola]] later created a proto-husk of Egghead as part of his Corpse Corps. Deadpool fought and killed the Egghead proto-husk, who then had a small bird pop out of his skull.<ref>''Deadpool'' Vol. 3 #0</ref>

In ''[[Fall of the Hulks]]: Alpha,'' a flashback showed that Egghead was a member of [[Intelligencia (comics)|Intelligencia]].<ref>''Fall of the Hulks: Alpha''</ref>

Egghead later turns up alive where he was behind the A.I.Vengers that he had computer technician Raz Malhotra activate upon placing a neural override on him. Egghead's activities attracted the attention of Hank Pym (in his Giant-Man alias) and [[Ant-Man (Scott Lang)|Ant-Man]]. After breaking free of the neural override, Raz shuts down the A.I.Vengers and Egghead is knocked out by Hank Pym.<ref>''Ant-Man Annual'' Vol. 2 #1</ref>

Egghead is later hired by [[Darren Cross]] to work for [[Cross Technological Enterprises]]. To help Cross control his Pym Particle-related abilities, Egghead creates the [[Yellowjacket (Marvel Comics)|Yellowjacket]] armor for him to wear.<ref>''Astonishing Ant-Man'' #12</ref>

Egghead later accompanies Yellowjacket and [[Crossfire (comics)|Crossfire]] into attacking Scott Lang at his trial.<ref>''Astonishing Ant-Man'' #13</ref>

===Robot===
A new Egghead appears as a member of the new [[Young Masters|Young Avengers]].<ref>''Dark Reign: Young Avengers'' #1</ref> This version is a robot. Although his original programming was "to respect all human life," a female [[neo-Nazi]] named Big Zero (who seems to have a relationship with this Egghead) has reprogrammed him to hate several minorities.<ref>''Dark Reign: Young Avengers'' {{Issue|date=October 2009}}</ref>

Egghead was later recruited by the villain [[Zodiac (comics)|Zodiac]] (who was the benefactor of the Young Masters) to join his army.<ref>''Vengeance'' #6</ref>

In the pages of ''[[Avengers Undercover]]'', Egghead was with the Young Masters when they are seen in [[Bagalia]] as members of the Masters of Evil.<ref>''Avengers Undercover'' #2</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Although he had no superhuman powers of his own, Egghead's incredible genius intellect made him a formidable foe. He was particularly skilled in the fields of robotics and engineering, and could absorb new ideas and knowledge at a seemingly superhuman rate. He had a degree in atomic science, and extensive knowledge in a wide variety of scientific and technological disciplines. Starr designed a wide variety of sophisticated weapons and technological paraphernalia.

As of ''Dark Reign: Young Avengers'' #1, Egghead II's powers have not been fully revealed. He has so far demonstrated the ability to fly and the power to phase his hand through a person's skull.
