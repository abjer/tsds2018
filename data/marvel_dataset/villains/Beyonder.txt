The '''Beyonder''' is a fictional [[Cosmic entity (Marvel Comics)|cosmic entity]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Created by writer [[Jim Shooter]]<ref name="Rivera">{{cite web|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|title=Go big or go home: Why Marvel's new 'Secret Wars' could be too much|first=Joshua|last=Rivera|date=October 10, 2014|url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2014/10/10/go-big-or-go-home-why-marvels-new-secret-wars-could-be-too-much/}}</ref> and artist [[Mike Zeck]], the Beyonder first appeared in ''[[Secret Wars]]'' #1 (May 1984) as an unseen, nearly omnipotent being who kidnapped the heroes and villains of the [[Marvel Universe]] and had them do battle on another planet called Battleworld.

The character later appeared in a more antagonistic role in the 1985 sequel ''[[Secret Wars II]]'', in which he took human form, and threatened to destroy the Marvel multiverse. Although he first took on a physical, humanoid form in ''Secret Wars II'' #2, it was in ''Secret Wars II'' #3 that he took on the permanent form in which he remained for the rest of his existence, that of a Caucasian human male with curly black hair. Although the character met his demise at the end of ''Secret Wars II'', he has subsequently appeared in stories well into the 2000s, although in greatly diminished form.

==Fictional character biography==

===''Secret Wars''===
The Beyonder is the sum total of an entire multiverse,<ref>{{cite web| url= http://i39.servimg.com/u/f39/19/00/38/35/41498710.jpg | title= [Excerpt of synopsis] |format= Comic book | publisher= Marvel Comics | access-date= August 28, 2017| via= servimg.com}}</ref> called the Beyond-Realm or simply "Beyond", hence the name ''Beyonder''. This dimension was originally believed to be accidentally accessed by lab technician [[Molecule Man|Owen Reece]]. Part of the energy from the dimension escapes and imbues Reece with near-infinite powers, which he wields as the villainous [[Molecule Man]]—potentially one of the most powerful villains in the [[Marvel Universe]]. The remaining energy of the pocket dimension gains sentience and curiosity, and becomes the Beyonder. The Beyonder creates a planet called Battleworld out of pieces of various planets (one such piece being a suburb of [[Denver]], [[Colorado]]) and abducts a number of [[superhero]]es and [[supervillain]]s from Earth and forces them to fight each other so that he can observe the never-ending battle between good and evil. During this time, his powers were once stolen by [[Doctor Doom]].<ref>''Marvel Super Heroes Secret Wars'' (vol. 1) #10 (February 1985)</ref>

===''Secret Wars II''===
Intrigued by what he has witnessed during the first Secret Wars, the Beyonder comes to Earth during the ''[[Secret Wars II]]'' story line to walk among humans and study them and learn of human desire firsthand. He creates a human body for himself (this body originally resembles Molecule Man). He also transforms a television writer named Steward Cadwell into [[Thundersword]].<ref>''Secret Wars II'' #1</ref> Finally, the Beyonder creates a form for himself based on that of [[Captain America]] after witnessing him defeat [[Armadillo (comics)|Armadillo]].<ref>''Captain America'' #308</ref>

After learning of the importance of money from [[Luke Cage]], the Beyonder turns a building into pure gold,<ref>''Secret Wars II'' #2</ref> causing [[Spider-Man]] to rescue those trapped in the building, while the U.S. government works to get rid of the gold to avoid a financial crisis.<ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' #6</ref> The Beyonder later meets the blind superhero [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]] and restores his ability to see, asking for legal representation in return. After realizing that the desire to protect his eyesight might compromise his integrity and dedication, Daredevil demands that the Beyonder take his sight away again, which he does.<ref>''Daredevil'' #223</ref> Beyonder then attempts to get [[Dazzler]] to fall in love with him, but fails, leading to feelings of despair.<ref>''Secret Wars II'' #4</ref> Following this, the Beyonder is recruited to be a professional wrestler and is nearly killed by [[Thing (comics)|The Thing]] in a wrestling match.<ref>''The Thing'' #30</ref>

After being encouraged to find enlightenment by [[Doctor Strange]], and failing, a frustrated Beyonder decides to destroy the entire multiverse, leading to several more battles with various Marvel superheroes, all of which end up with the Beyonder victorious. The Beyonder is finally defeated by a huge group of superheroes, including the [[Fantastic Four]], [[X-Men]], [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], and [[Spider-Man]], after the [[Molecule Man]] intervenes and kills him, while he had temporarily transformed into an infant in the midst of a re-birthing process.<ref>''Secret Wars II'' #9</ref>

===''Deadpool Team-Up''===
Long after the ''Secret Wars II'' crossover had ended, a [[Deadpool]] special featured the "Secret Wars II continues in this issue" corner tag that was used during that original storyline. In this issue, a younger, less-experienced Deadpool is hired by the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] to kill the Beyonder. The flashback sequence ends with Deadpool chasing him into a portal with a footnote saying "to be continued in Secret Wars III".<ref>''[[Deadpool]] Team-up'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Kosmos and Maker===
The tale of the Beyonder continues several years later when it is revealed that the energy which comprises the Beyonder and the energy that gives the [[Molecule Man]] his powers needs to be combined in order to create the basis for a mentally stable, mature cosmic entity to be born. The Beyonder then merges with the Molecule Man.<ref>"Secret Wars 3", ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' #319. Marvel Comics.</ref> This being, [[Kosmos (Marvel Comics)|Kosmos]], expels the Molecule Man from its form, and returns him to Earth. Kosmos takes on a female form and is tutored by [[Kubik (comics)|Kubik]], touring the universe with him.<ref>''Fantastic Four Annual'' #23. Marvel Comics.</ref> When the Molecule Man's lover [[Volcana (Marvel Comics)|Volcana]] leaves him, he becomes angry, extracts the Beyonder from Kosmos, and proceeds to attack him until Kubik intervenes.<ref name= "FF27"/>

At some unknown point, Kosmos becomes insane and assumes a mortal form, now calling itself the Maker. After the [[amnesia]]c Maker destroys a [[Shi'ar]] colony, the [[Imperial Guard (comics)|Imperial Guard]] manage to imprison it in the interstellar prison called the [[Kyln]]. The Maker's madness takes control of several inmates but is finally subdued by [[Thanos]] and several of his allies among the prisoners. Thanos confronts the Maker, and, by refusing to reveal its origins at a critical juncture, manipulates it to psychically shut down its own mind. Thanos instructs the Shi'ar that the body should be kept alive but brain-dead, or the Beyonder essence would go free again.<ref>''Thanos'' #10 (2003). Marvel Comics.</ref>

==="Annihilation"===
In the "[[Annihilation (comics)|Annihilation]]" crossover story line, the [[Fallen One]], a former [[Galactus|Herald of Galactus]] under the control of [[Thanos]],<ref>''Thanos'' #12 (2004)</ref> is sent to investigate the aftermath of the [[Kyln]]'s destruction by the [[Annihilation Wave]] and ascertain the Beyonder's fate. The Fallen One finds the lifeless form of Kosmos in the rubble.<ref>''Annihilation: Silver Surfer'' #1 (April 2006). Marvel Comics.</ref>

===The Illuminati===

In a [[retcon]] of past events, [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]] reveals to his fellow [[Illuminati (comics)|Illuminati]] members that in the original Secret War, he had attempted to mind-scan the Beyonder, revealing him as one of the [[Inhumans]] previously ruled over by fellow Illuminati member [[Black Bolt]]. Xavier also deduced the apparent secret behind the Beyonder's seemingly godlike abilities, which was that the Beyonder was not only an Inhuman but also a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]], and the exposure of his mutant genes to [[Terrigen Mist]]s had created an unprecedented power.<ref>[http://www.popcultureshock.com/new-avengers-illuminati-3/41826/ "New Avengers: Illuminati #3 Preview"]. Pop Culture Shock. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100830031726/http://www.popcultureshock.com/new-avengers-illuminati-3/41826/ |date=August 30, 2010 }}</ref>
	
This revelation leads to a confrontation with the Beyonder during the events of the second Secret War, wherein Black Bolt expresses his extreme displeasure toward the Beyonder's activities. When encountered, the Beyonder is dwelling in a simulacrum of Manhattan Island on [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]], a [[dwarf planet]] in the [[asteroid belt]].<ref>''New Avengers: The Illuminati'' #3. Marvel Comics</ref>

===Time Runs Out===
It was revealed in ''Secret Wars Official Guide to the Marvel Multiverse'' that in the distant past, the enigmatic [[Beyonders]] created [[pocket universe]]s holding vast amounts of sentient energy, possibly as incubator units for their young. Some were later tapped into by various beings, including [[Skrull]]s and Humans, to create reality-warping [[Cosmic Cube]]s. The Beyonders also had engineered an accident that created a pinhole to the universe containing the "Child Unit" Beyonder which had also caused Molecule Man to obtain his power. [[Hank Pym|Yellowjacket]] described the Beyonder as a "child unit" to the Beyonders.<ref>''New Avengers'' (vol. 3) #30 (April 2015). Marvel Comics.</ref><ref>''Secret Wars Official Guide to the Marvel Multiverse'' #1 (October 2015). Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
The Beyonder is an [[Hilbert space|infinite-dimensional being]],<ref>''Secret Wars II'' #2 (Aug. 1985). Marvel Comics</ref> and was originally portrayed as the most powerful being in the Marvel Universe, and as the be-all and end-all of the "Beyond Realm"<ref>''Secret Wars II'' #8 (1986). Marvel Comics</ref> that took human form to better understand the nature of human beings.

The narration stated that he possessed power millions of times greater than the entire multiverse combined,<ref name="SWII9">''Secret Wars II'' vol.1 #9 (March 1986). Marvel Comics</ref> and that a regular universe was as a drop of water in the ocean compared to the Beyond Realm.<ref name="SWII4">[http://img2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20140812053848/powerlisting/images/1/15/Stan_Lee_called_beyonder_omnipotent_.jpg ''Secret Wars II'' vol.1 #4 (Oct. 1985)]. Marvel Comics</ref>

The Beyonder proved capable of destroying, and recreating, the abstract entity known as [[Death (Marvel Comics)|Death]] across the multiverse, although it extremely exerted and weakened him to do so. However, even in this state, he was capable of easily sending a horde of demons back to hell with a wave of his hand.<ref>''Secret Wars II'' #6 (1985). Marvel Comics</ref>

Despite his power, the Beyonder showed his very own moments of possible vulnerability. He was overwhelmed when [[Rachel Summers]] returned the enormous powers that he had bestowed upon her along with the thoughts of the past and present beings in the universe, to the point that he collapsed on the ground,<ref>[http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/56904/2226158-beyonder_vs_phoenix2.jpg ''Uncanny X-Men'' #203]. Marvel Comics</ref> and he was apparently slowed down in battle against the [[Molecule Man]].<ref>[http://media.animevice.com/uploads/0/4813/274235-moleculeman_super.jpg ''Secret Wars II'' #9 (1985)]. Marvel Comics</ref> He also lost part, or all, of his power on various occasions, some of them engineered by himself.<ref name="SWII9"/><ref name="SWII4"/><ref>''Secret Wars'' #10 (Feb. 1985)]. Marvel Comics</ref> He also stated that the [[Puma (comics)|Puma]]—when in perfect harmony with the Universe—was capable of killing him, but there was no proof of this.<ref>''Peter Parker the Spectacular Spider-Man'' #111. Marvel Comics</ref> However, on another occasion, after trying to be a superhero by fighting a superpowered biker gang, the Beyonder stated that he ''tried'' to limit his powers to keep them more in line with the world around him.<ref>[http://marvel.wikia.com/Dazzler_Vol_1_40 ''Dazzler'' Vol.1 #40 (Nov. 1985)]. Marvel Comics</ref>

After his creator, [[Jim Shooter]], left Marvel, writer-editor [[Tom DeFalco]] re-tooled the Beyonder, diminishing his power greatly: He was no longer nearly omnipotent, and several of the cosmic beings who were previously established to be below him in power were vastly upgraded in conjunction.<ref name="FF27"/><ref>''Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe'' Vol.2 #7 (June 1986). Marvel Comics</ref><ref>''Fantastic Four'' #319 (1988). Marvel Comics</ref><ref name="FF23"/>

Nonetheless, the Beyonder retained his reality-warping powers, allowing him to control and manipulate matter, energy, and reality at a cosmic level beyond all but the strongest and most powerful of [[cosmic entities (Marvel Comics)|cosmic entities]].

He repelled [[Galactus]] "like a bug",<ref name="SW1">''Marvel Super Heroes Secret Wars'' #1. Marvel Comics</ref> and exceeded the collected energy of the latter's World-Ship.<ref>''Marvel Super Heroes Secret Wars'' #10. Marvel Comics</ref> He once destroyed a galaxy on a whim to meet his needs during the first Secret Wars,<ref name="SW1"/> and later created a universe out of his own being.<ref name="FF319">''Fantastic Four'' #319. Marvel Comics</ref> When the Molecule Man extracted the Beyonder from Kosmos, their battle took place in more than three spatial dimensions, and threatened to cause vast destruction across the multiverse.<ref name="FF27">''Fantastic Four Annual'' #27 (1994). Marvel Comics</ref> In Kosmos' 'Maker' incarnation, she was stated as capable of reversing [[Antimatter#Antiuniverse|The Crunch]] itself, essentially collapsing the entire universe.<ref>''Thanos'' #10-12. Marvel Comics</ref> However, his scale of power was stated to be significantly below that of the [[Living Tribunal]] and [[Eternity (Marvel Comics)|Eternity]],<ref name="FF319"/> the [[Celestials (comics)|Celestials]],<ref name="FF23">''Fantastic Four Annual'' #23 (1990)</ref> or the Molecule Man (when unfettered from his emotional weaknesses).<ref name="FF27"/>

==Other versions==
In the Earth-691 timeline seen in ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (1969 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'', the Beyonder provides Guardian [[Vance Astro]] with a black undergarment resembling a [[Symbiote (comics)|Symbiote]].<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy'' #38 (1993). Marvel Comics</ref> Later, he attempts to hold captive the ruler of the Universal Church of Truth, [[List of Marvel Comics characters: P|Protégé]]. Protégé retaliates using his limitless ability to copy the abilities of other beings to become a match for the Beyonder. They battle until Eternity and The Living Tribunal intervene.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Guardians of the Galaxy #50|last=|first=|publisher=Marvel Comics|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>

In the alternate Earth of ''[[Mutant X (comics)|Mutant X]]'', the Beyonder allies with Dracula, to wage war on Earth's forces and to confront the entity known as the '[[Madelyne Pryor#Mutant X|Goblyn Queen]]'. Many of the Mutant X heroes are killed in this confrontation. The battle ends up threatening all realities.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

The creator [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] once parodied the Beyonder by letting [[Mister Mxyzptlk]] assume a form and identity that was similar in clothing and appearance to the Beyonder in this first appearance in the post-Crisis continuity. He called himself ''"Ben Deroy"'', an anagram of the name "Beyonder." When he was asked by [[Lois Lane]] where he came from, he answers by saying, ''"Oh...here and there. Yonder, let's say. Yes. Yonder."''<ref>''Superman'' #11. [[DC Comics]].</ref>

In the ''[[Spider-Ham]]'' universe, "The Bee-Yonder" briefly appears to give Spider-Ham a version of the black uniform, stating that the familiar red-and-blue uniform was out of style.<ref>''Spider-Ham'' #17. Marvel Comics</ref> He also appeared in the back-up tale in the last issue of ''Spider-Ham'' as having abducted the various heroes and villains and cast them in TV programs such as situation comedies and game shows.{{issue|date=December 2016}}

The Behinder was another satirical version of the Beyonder, that appeared in Marvel's ''[[What The--?!]]'' humor magazine.{{issue|date=December 2014}}

* The Beyonder appeared in the final episodes of ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]'', voiced by [[Earl Boen]].{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} This version is depicted as the companion of [[Madame Web]]. To prepare [[Spider-Man]] for the role as the Chosen One, Beyonder teleports [[Doctor Octopus]], [[Doctor Doom]], [[Alistair Smythe]], [[Lizard (comics)|Lizard]] and [[Red Skull]] to a peaceful planet and accelerated its time to where they conquered it.
