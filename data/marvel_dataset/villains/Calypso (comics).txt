'''Calypso Ezili''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]].

==Publication history==
Calypso first appeared in ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #209 and was created by [[Denny O'Neil]] and [[Alan Weiss (comics)|Alan Weiss]].

Calypso initially appeared as a minor character ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #209 and ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man|Peter Parker, The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' #65, where  she was an ally of [[Spider-Man]]'s enemy [[Kraven the Hunter]]. After Kraven's death, Calypso bewitched [[Lizard (comics)|the Lizard]] into helping her attack Spider-Man in ''[[Peter Parker: Spider-Man|Spider-Man]]'' Vol. 1, #1-5, then made guest appearances in ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]'' Vol. 1, #310-311 and ''Daredevil Annual'' Vol. 1, #9. Calypso next appeared in ''[[Web of Spider-Man]]'' Vol. 1, #109-110 and ''Spider-Man Annual'' 1997, and was killed-off in a storyline that spanned ''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' Vol. 1, #249-253.

==Fictional character biography==
Calypso was a nameless [[Haitian Vodou|voodoo]] priestess of [[Haiti]]an nationality.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spiderfan.org/characters/calypso.html|title=Spiderfan.org}}</ref> She was a [[psychopath]]ic woman who was associated with [[Kraven the Hunter]]. Calypso seemed to enjoy driving Kraven into fits of rage and furthering his hatred of [[Spider-Man]] which ultimately led to Kraven's [[suicide]] in the "[[Kraven's Last Hunt]]" storyline.<ref>''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man#Volume One (1976-1998)|The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' #132. Marvel Comics.</ref>

When artist [[Todd McFarlane]] started writing the new ''Spider-Man'' comic in 1990, his opening five-issue story arc "[[Torment (comics)|Torment]]" featured Calypso as the main antagonist, whom McFarlane transformed into a dangerous threat for Spider-Man. The explanation for Calypso's supernatural powers was the sacrifice of her younger sister. She used her abilities to hold [[Lizard (comics)|Lizard]] in her grasp and the two nearly succeeded in murdering Spider-Man. However, the webslinger managed to beat them both and Calypso was apparently killed.<ref>''[[Peter Parker: Spider-Man|Spider-Man]]'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Her voodoo prevented her from truly dying and Calypso returned again. Commanding a squad of savages, she attacked Spider-Man and [[Kraven the Hunter (Alyosha Kravinoff)|Alyosha Kravinoff]], the son of the original Kraven the Hunter. Desiring revenge for losing Sergei, she used her powers to drive Spidey and Alyosha into fighting each other. Spidey and Alyosha fought off her spell, and shared a handshake. Alyosha said that he would hold Calypso at his mansion, so the villainess could tell him about his long-lost father. However, Alyosha killed Calypso instead.<ref>''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #249-253. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Calypso survived by using voodoo to enter a series of host bodies which she used to fight Spider-Man and Daredevil.<ref>''Daredevil Annual'' #9. Marvel Comics.</ref> Calypso did a number of campaigns against them that involved her servant [[Zombie (comics)|Zombie]].<ref>''Spider-Man Annual 1997''. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Calypso was well-versed in the religion and practice of voodoo. She often used voodoo drums, potions, and charms. Calypso used mind control, resurrection, and poisons.

==Other versions==
===What If?===
An issue of ''[[What If (comics)|What If?]]'' which asked the question "What If Spider-Man Killed the Lizard?" had Calypso in it. When Spider-Man is forced to kill the Lizard in an alternate version of the "[[Torment (comics)|Torment]]" story-arc, Calypso approaches the Lizard's distraught son [[Billy Connors (comics)|Billy Connors]] and offers him the chance to get revenge on Spider-Man via a potion that will make him "just like daddy."<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Simon Furman|penciller = Dane McCart|inker = Dane McCart|colorist = Mark Bernardo|letterer = Janice Chiang|editor = Rob Tokar|story = What If Spider-Man Killed the Lizard?|title = What If?|volume = 2|issue = #53|date = 10 September 1993|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref>

==In other media==
===Television===
* In the 1990s ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]'', Calypso was initially introduced as a research scientist named '''Dr. Mariah Crawford''' (voiced by [[Susan Beaubian]]) who was engaged to Sergei Kravinoff before his mystic serum transformed him into Kraven the Hunter who affectionately calls her "Calypso". She assisted Spider-Man in several episodes, most notably helping him develop a cure for the [[The Six Arms Saga#Television|Man-Spider mutation]] where even [[Professor X]] had expressed doubt about his ability to develop a cure. During the confrontation with Man-Spider, Dr. Crawford was shown to be familiar with [[Punisher]]'s backstory and persuaded him to help Kraven the Hunter subdue the Man-Spider. She was able to administer the antidote to Spider-Man's Man-Spider form with the help of Kraven the Hunter and Punisher. In the episode "The Return of Kraven," Dr. Mariah Crawford came down with a disease at the time when she was in Africa. This prompted Sergei to use the serum on her. After returning from Africa, the serum caused Mariah to transform into a feral woman who greatly resembled the comic version of Calypso with this form also being depicted with claws, green eyes, and lion-like ears. Sergei had to take the serum again to track her down when she starts attacking people in the park at night (which at the time Spider-Man thought it was Kraven). After a struggle with Kraven, Spider-Man and Black Cat assisted Kraven into subduing Calypso and administer the cure made by Dr. Curt Connors which was able to reverse some of the transformation's mental effects while getting rid of the claws, green eyes, and lion-like ears. She and Kraven eventually left to be alone.
* Calypso appears in the [[The Spectacular Spider-Man (TV series)|''Spectacular Spider-Man'']] episode "Destructive Testing," voiced by [[Angela Bryant]].<ref>[http://www.comicscontinuum.com/stories/0801/21/index.htm Comics Continuum by Rob Allstetter: Monday, January 21, 2008<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In this series, Calypso is Kraven's lover and there is some indication she is a voodoo priestess. She presents to Kraven pictures of Spider-Man from a mysterious American friend and encourages him to go to New York and hunt him. After Kraven's first attempt at killing Spider-Man, she suddenly appears in a robe and says, "You have need of me, love?". He states that he did not call her and declines her offer of help. After Kraven's second defeat at the hands of Spider-Man, Calypso rescues him and reveals that their friend has revealed himself as the [[Doctor Octopus|Master Planner]]. The Master Planner then asks Kraven if he would like to "hunt in a [[Sinister Six|pack]]".

===Video games===
* Calypso appears as a secret boss at the end of the [[video game]] ''[[Spider-Man 2 (video game)|Spider-Man 2]]'' voiced by [[Angela V. Shelton]].
* Calypso appears in ''[[Spider-Man 3 (video game)|Spider-Man 3]]'', voiced again by Shelton. She assists Kraven the Hunter by providing him with various potions and mutating the [[Lizard (comics)|Lizard]] into an even larger, more monstrous form.
* A [[Marvel Noir]] version of Calypso appears as an exclusive villain in the [[Nintendo DS]] version of ''[[Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions]]'', voiced by [[Jennifer Hale]]. Calypso uses her fragment of the Tablet of Order and Chaos to raise an army of zombies. She also hopes to use it to revive Kraven in a ritual. Calypso is eventually defeated by [[Spider-Man Noir]].
