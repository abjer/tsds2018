'''Dr. Mendel Stromm''' is a fictional supervillain appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character has also been known as '''Robot Master''' and '''Gaunt'''.

==Publication history==
{{expand section|date=April 2014}}
Stromm first appeared in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #37 (June 1966), and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Steve Ditko]].

==Fictional character biography==
Mendel Stromm was [[Norman Osborn]]'s college professor and later became a partner in [[Oscorp|OsCorp Industries]]. His early research was on a chemical that would provide enhanced strength in its test subjects and would eventually turn Osborn into the [[Green Goblin]]. Osborn, wanting the formula for himself, discovered that Stromm had been embezzling funds from OsCorp. Stromm explained that he was merely borrowing but Osborn turned him over to the police. After several years in prison, Stromm was released and tried to kill Osborn for revenge using evil robots. He was stopped by [[Spider-Man]] and seemingly died of a heart attack when he was nearly shot.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #37 (1966)</ref>

Stromm had made plans for his death, however, by arranging to have his brain waves transferred to a robot double. Now calling himself "Robot Master", Stromm returned in ''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #68 (July 1982).  Spider-Man defeated and destroyed the robot double.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #68 (July 1982)</ref>

In ''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #233 (April 1996), Stromm returned again, this time as a cyborg called "Gaunt". It was revealed that he survived through a cybernetic suit fused to his body - attached by none other than Osborn.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #233 (April 1996)</ref> Osborn had discovered that Stromm had survived his heart attack thanks to the Goblin Serum, but on a level of consciousness supported only by his suit. Eventually, via Seward Trainer, he was cured of his need for the suit and came back in a large suit of robotic armor,<ref>''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #240</ref> only for it to be destroyed by [[Ben Reilly]] and Peter Parker despite Stromm's attempt to defeat them both with two flying robots and three childlike androids attacking simultaneously.<ref>''The Sensational Spider-Man'' #11</ref> Shortly afterward, Norman Osborn knocked him out with a laser blast and left him for dead, though he survived and only had amnesia.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #418</ref> He came back in yet another robot suit, only to be stopped by Spider-Man once again.<ref>''Spider-Man Unlimited'' #17</ref>

In ''Peter Parker: Spider-Man'' vol. 2, #27 (March 2001), Stromm tried to create a [[artificial intelligence|sentient robot]] to kill Osborn, but it turned on him and destroyed his body, keeping his severed head alive. This artificial intelligence then attempted to take over [[New York City]]'s electrical grid, but was stopped when Spider-Man fought his way into its [[central processing unit|core processor]] and uploaded a [[computer virus]] into it, putting both the A. I. and Mendel into a [[coma]]tose state.<ref>''Peter Parker: Spider-Man'' #27-28</ref>

The artificial intelligence took over [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]]'s body and tried to use his powers to create a horde of self spawning robots,{{issue|date=December 2012}} but after the interference of Spider-Man the AI altered Spidey's spider sense, after which Spider-Man defeated the AI.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

In ''Penance: Relentless'' (2007), it is revealed that Spider-Man tipped [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] off to Stromm's whereabouts and that they were able to rescue him from the suspended loop he was stuck in. He eagerly registered as part of the Initiative. Later, [[Robbie Baldwin|Penance]] goes [[AWOL]] on the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] and stages an assault on Stromm's home, threatening to kill him unless Stromm tells him how to activate nuclear launch codes Penance has stolen in a bid to get [[Nitro (comics)|Nitro]] deported from [[Latveria]].<ref>''Penance: Relentless'' #1-2</ref>

During the ''[[Civil War II]]'' storyline, Mendel Stromm meets [[Clash (comics)|Clayton Cole]] at the henchman bar called Moynihan's Social Club during its [[happy hour]]. He gives Clash an offer to work for him in his plan to get revenge on [[Harry Osborn]]. While sporting the new version of his Clash outfit that he ordered from [[Tinkerer]], Clayton Cole arrives at Mendel Stromm's apartment where he meets with Stromm in his Robot Master form and his robots. Robot Master then compliments Clash's outfit and claims that Spider-Man won't know what hit him. When Clash attacks Robot Master stating that he will look out for himself, Robot Master unleashes his robots on Clash even when Spider-Man arrives. Spider-Man manages to web Robot Master in the air with foam web. When Spider-Man was talking Clash into getting back to the civilized life, Robot Master rises and attacks them. While Clash flies away, Spider-Man defeats Robot Master by ripping his remote control mechanics from within his robot body, deactivating his robot army.<ref>''Civil War II: Amazing Spider-Man'' #2-4</ref>
