Reed Richards gets engulfed in a malfunctioned teleporter experiment to get the superpower to stretch. The character was created by [[Brian Michael Bendis]], [[Mark Millar]] and [[Adam Kubert]]. Ulimate Reed debuted in early [[2004 in comics|2004]] in the series [[Ultimate Fantastic Four]] as its leader.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=19933 |title=NYCC: Joe Pokaski On "Ultimate Fantastic Four Requiem" |publisher=Comic Book Resources |date= |accessdate=2011-02-25}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
[[File:Ultimate Mister Fantastic (Earth 1610).png|thumb|upright|left|Reed Richards' Earth-1610 counterpart<br>{{Descript-cvr-art|[[Ultimate Fantastic Four]]|10|August 2004|pub=Marvel|art=Stuart Immonen}}]]
Reed is a [[child prodigy|child genius]] who at the age of 11, following a demonstration of his research on the field of [[teleportation]] at a school science fair, Reed was recruited for a government program which sponsors young [[genius]]es' research. He continued his research at the government "think tank" research facility located in [[Manhattan|Manhattan's]] Baxter Building run by Professor Storm. Reed meets [[Alternative versions of the Human Torch#Ultimate Marvel|Johnny]] and [[Invisible Woman#Ultimate Marvel|Sue Storm]]. Reed is romantically involved with Sue Storm. [[Alternative versions of the Thing#Ultimate Marvel|Ben Grimm]] is his only friend and protector. At the age of 21, his research was realized as he and several others attempted to teleport organic material through an alternate [[Plane (esotericism)|plane of existence]] called the [[Negative Zone#Ultimate Marvel|N-Zone]]. The experiment went wrong giving Reed and several others superpowers. Reed's powers enable him to stretch his body parts to incredible lengths and endow him with enhanced durability.

After "[[Ultimatum (Ultimate Marvel)|Ultimatum]]" resulted in the death of many heroes, the Ultimate Fantastic Four decided to disband and Reed and Sue broke up.  Reed is later seen aiding or leading aliens to pillage the artifacts stored at [[Project Pegasus#Ultimate Marvel|Project Pegasus]]. As the story unfolds, it becomes clear that Reed Richards' worldview has changed and he has villanious intents. In ''[[Ultimate Enemy]]'', he is shown to be living with his parents again before an explosion seemingly kills them.<ref>Ultimate Enemy #1</ref> In ''[[Ultimate Mystery]]'', Reed is assumed dead but at the end of the series, Susan Storm discovers that Reed Richards is alive and in alliance with the attacking aliens.<ref>Ultimate Mystery #1</ref> 

''[[Ultimate Doom]]'' sees Reed confronted by the remaining members of the [[Ultimate Fantastic Four|Fantastic Four]], as well as [[Ultimate Spider-Man|Spider-Man]], [[Mahr Vehl]], and the [[Ultimates]]. As the story unfolds, it becomes clear to his former friends that Reed Richards is a threat to society. Part of his motivation to become a villian is that he no longer likes his home dimension and wishes his friends could find another world to improve.<ref>''Ultimate Doom''</ref>

In ''[[Ultimate Fallout]]'', Reed is revealed to have survived his defeat and is shown trapped in the [[Negative Zone]]. He soon escapes and makes his way back to his world, where he vows to win back his friends by saving the planet.<ref>Ultimate Fallout #4</ref> In ''[[Ultimate Comics: The Ultimates]]'', Reed Richards is revealed to be the Maker, creator of The City and the [[Future Foundation#Ultimate Marvel|Children of Tomorrow]], a race of genetically engineered supermen. Reed has come back to fight against the Ultimates after spending 1,000 years to the distant future - having been unable to age due to his powers - and the top of his head has been 'stretched' in order to increase his intelligence. It is not until Reed reveals his face to Thor that the Ultimates learn his true identity as the Maker.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Jonathan Hickman]] | Penciller = [[Esad Ribic]] and [[Brandon Peterson]] | Colorist = [[John Rauch]] | Title = Ultimate Comics: Ultimates | Issue = 10 | Date = April 2012 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref> Invisible Woman traps the Maker into a small psychic bubble, but he surives.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Jonathan Hickman]] | Penciller = [[Esad Ribic]] and [[Brandon Peterson]] | Colorist = [[John Rauch]] | Title = Ultimate Comics: Ultimates | Issue = 12 | Date = June 2012 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref> Later the Maker assembles part of the Infinity Gauntlet.<ref>''Ultimate Comics: Ultimates'' #25</ref>

When the primary [[Galactus]] arrives in the Ultimate universe due to a temporal distortion,<ref>''Age of Ultron'' #12</ref> the Ultimates are forced to approach Reed for help after [[Mysterio]] (who was trapped in the Ultimate universe when he tried to trap his [[Spider-Men|Spider-Man in that world]]) identifies Galactus and reveals that he has been defeated by his world's Reed Richards in the past.<ref>''Cataclysm: The Ultimates' Last Stand'' #2</ref> Accompanied by [[Miles Morales|the new Spider-Man]], Reed travels to Earth-616 to access his counterpart's files. Before he departs, he and Miles are confronted by [[Valeria Richards]], leaving Reed shaken as he witnesses the family he and Sue could have had.<ref>''Cataclysm: The Ultimates' Last Stand'' #3</ref> Based on his counterpart's files on Galactus, Reed defeats Galactus by sending him to the [[Negative Zone]], where he could starve to death due to the Negative Zone consisting entirely of anti-matter and thus providing nothing for Galactus to consume.<ref>''Cataclysm: The Ultimates' Last Stand'' #5</ref>

===Secret Wars===
Nick Fury secretly recruits Reed to be his new mastermind for creating counter-measures to doomsday scenarios, where he eventually starts having to fight Incursions. While working on stopping another, he finds [[Cabal (comics)|The Cabal]] escaping from another destroyed Earth.<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 5 #41</ref>  Following the final incursion, Reed and the Cabal escape the destruction of Earth-1610 in a 'life-raft' created for that purpose (accompanied by an invisible [[Miles Morales]]). Learning that they are on a new world ruled by Doctor Doom using the power of the [[Beyonders]] and the Molecule Men, Ultimate Reed works with his Earth-616 counterpart to devise a means of defeating Doom, but they are divided due to their morals, as Ultimate Reed wishes to kill their enemy while 616-Reed is more concerned with ensuring that the world can survive without him.<ref>''Secret Wars'' (2015 series) #6</ref> After they find the Molecule Man, the Maker attempts to eliminate 616-Reed by devolving him into a monkey, but the Molecule Man intervenes, returning Reed to normal while turning the Maker into pepperoni pizzas.<ref>''Secret Wars'' (2015 series) #9</ref>

===New Avengers===
Despite this, the Maker has survived and emerged in the new 'Prime Earth' where he forms scientist/terrorist organization W.H.I.S.P.E.R. (World Headquarters for International Scientific/Philosophical Experimentation and Research) to continue experimenting for his own gain. His first experiment focuses on harnessing the souls of the dead to try and capture the souls of previous universes.<ref>''New Avengers'' Vol 4 #1</ref>

Maker assembles a new incarnation of the [[Revengers]] dubbed the New Revengers with plans to have them face the New Avengers. They consist of Asti the All-Seeing, [[Paibok]], [[Vermin (comics)|Vermin]], [[White Tiger (Angela del Toro)|White Tiger]], and alternate versions of [[List of Marvel Comics characters: A#Angar the Screamer|Angar the Screamer]] and Skar.<ref>''New Avengers'' Vol. 4 #7</ref>

During the ''[[Civil War II]]'' storyline, the New Revengers gain City's O.M.N.I.T.R.O.C.U.S form as its latest member.<ref>''New Avengers'' Vol. 4 #12</ref> At the time when [[Advanced Idea Mechanics#Avengers Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]] was facing off against S.H.I.E.L.D., Maker took advantage of this by sending his New Revengers to attack them.<ref>''New Avengers'' Vol. 4 #13</ref> While O.M.N.I.T.R.O.C.U.S. kept [[Sunspot (comics)|Sunspot]] trapped in his office while having his own defense system attack him, Angela del Toro fought with her aunt [[White Tiger (Ava Ayala)|Ava Ayala]] while the other Revengers members attacked the rest of the New Avengers and the staff of Avengers Base Two.<ref>''New Avengers'' Vol. 4 #14</ref> Donning a variation of [[Pepper Potts]]' Rescue armor, [[Iron Patriot#Toni Ho|Toni Ho]] managed to slay the alternate Skar. Also, [[Mockingbird (Marvel Comics)|Mockingbird]] managed to get free from O.M.N.I.T.R.O.C.U.S.' clutches with the help of [[Warlock (New Mutants)|Warlock]] while Ava broke Angela free from the combined influences of the Tiger God and the [[The Hand (comics)|Hand]].<ref>''New Avengers'' Vol. 4 #15</ref> The remaining members of the New Revengers faced off against the New Avengers and the rest of the A.I.M. staff. While the remaining members of the New Revengers were defeated, Maker got away.<ref>''New Avengers'' Vol. 4 #16</ref> Sunspot later faced off against Maker at a fake [[Air Force One]] and defeated him. Sunspot then delivered Maker to the government where he was imprisoned in a special cell.<ref>''New Avengers'' Vol. 4 #17</ref>

===Eternity War===
An alternate version of the Maker (sharing the same consciousness as the one imprisoned by the New Avengers) arrived on the Counter Earth to collaborated with [[High Evolutionary]] to "evolve the entire multiverse".<ref>''The Ultimates 2'' Vol.2 #8</ref> The Maker uses the High Evolutionary's machinery to destroy the Superflow that kept the different universes separate, merging them into one reality to help Eternity fight the First Firmament.<ref>''The Ultimates 2'' Vol.2 #9</ref> He also uses the machine to revive the Earth-1610 Ultimates (Captain America, Iron Man, Giant-Man, Wasp, and Hulk) in case anyone tried to reverse his universal fusion.<ref>''Ultimates 2'' Vol. 2 #9</ref> When Earth-616's version of the Ultimates arrived on [[Counter-Earth (comics)|Counter-Earth]] to confront Maker about his actions (which have actually allowed the First Firmament an easier time in "digesting" Eternity), The Maker doesn't believe them and ordered the Earth-1610 Ultimates to attack. As both versions of Ultimates concluded that there is no reason to fight each other, Maker killed the Earth-1610 Captain America for disobeying his orders. After having been frozen by [[Monica Rambeau|Spectrum]] and shattered by the High Evolutionary, both Ultimates helped Eternity to defeat the First Firmament. Afterwards, the Earth-1610 Ultimates left to pursue the Makers across the universe.<ref>''Ultimates 2'' #100</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Ultimate Reed's powers of [[List of superhuman features and abilities in fiction#Elasticity|elasticity]] have been increased in comparison to his counterpart, [[Mister Fantastic]]. He can stretch his eyes, specifically the lens so that he does not need his glasses or any other visual augmentation but can only sustain this for short periods. Sue's mother revealed that she knows that Reed's abilities allow him to stretch his brain in order to accommodate and solve almost any problem thus making him effectively a human computer so Reed is a genius with an [[IQ]] of at least 267 at age 16.<ref>''Ultimate Fantastic Four'' #4 </ref> The Ultimate Reed has a limit to the length he can stretch to, since after catching the falling Carol Danvers after she is dropped by the Silver Surfer, and upon setting her down, he admits that it hurt him to stretch that far.<ref>''Ultimate Fantastic Four'' #44 </ref>

The Ultimate Reed experiences an increase in his intellect from the accident that empowered him, making his "mind as flexible as his body". He has shown a reduced need for sleep due to the hyper-efficient workings of his brain.<ref>''Ultimate Fantastic Four'' #25</ref> Ultimate Reed's body has been radically transformed, his only internal organ being a "bacterial stack" that generates energy to fuel his body.<ref>''Ultimate Fantastic Four'' #7</ref> This obviates the need to explain, for example, how his [[circulatory system]] can pump his blood when his body is stretched the length of a football field; he simply has none. Lacking a digestive system, he has no need to eat or drink. Similarly, because he has no lungs, Ultimate Reed does not need to breathe in any conventional human sense and can survive in environments lacking oxygen; during his time in the N-Zone, where the atmosphere is essentially acid and contains [[anti-matter]], he is able to survive.<ref>''Cataclysm: The Ultimates' Last Stand''</ref>

Ultimate Reed is extremely durable, surviving a nova flame attack from the [[Alternative_versions_of_the_Human_Torch#Ultimate_Marvel|Human Torch]], ionic attacks from the [[Alternative_versions_of_the_Thing#Ultimate_Marvel|Thing]] and having his brain blown up by [[Alternative_versions_of_Invisible_Woman#Ultimate_Marvel|Invisible Woman]]'s force fields.<ref>Ultimate Doomsday</ref> The Maker can split himself into multiple sentient beings that can operate separately from one another.<ref>Ultimate Comics: The Ultimates #27</ref>

Following the [[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret War]], The Maker was split into an infinite number of beings by the [[Molecule Man]], who placed one version of the Maker in each of the newly formed universes being created by the Earth-616 [[Reed Richards]] and [[Franklin Richards (Fantastic Four)|Franklin Richards]]. Each of these versions shares the same consciousness, allowing them to operate independently. This also enables him to teleport in a sense, by switching between different versions of himself from different universes.<ref>''The Ultimates 2'' Vol.2 #9</ref>
