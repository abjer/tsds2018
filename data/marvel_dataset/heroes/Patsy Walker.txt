==Publication history==

===Teen-humor heroine===
Created by writer [[Otto Binder]] and artist [[Ruth Atkinson]], Patsy Walker first appeared in ''Miss America Magazine'' #2 ([[cover-date]]d Nov. 1944), published by Marvel precursor [[Timely Comics]].<ref>[http://www.comics.org/issue/3970/ ''Miss America Magazine'' #2] at the Grand Comics Database.</ref> Redheaded Patsy Walker, her parents Stanley and [[Dorothy Walker (comics)|Betty]], her boyfriend [[Mad Dog (Marvel Comics)|Robert "Buzz" Baxter]], and her raven-haired friendly rival Hedy Wolfe appeared from the 1940s through 1967 in issues of ''Miss America'', ''Teen Comics'', ''Girls' Life'', and the namesake [[Teen humor comics|teen-humor]] series ''Patsy Walker''<ref>[http://www.comics.org/series/419/ ''Patsy Walker'' (Marvel, 1945 series)] at the Grand Comics Database.</ref> and its spin-offs: ''Patsy and Hedy'', ''Patsy and Her Pals'', and the single-issue ''A Date with Patsy''. Attesting to its quiet popularity, ''Patsy Walker'' (along with ''[[Millie the Model]]'' and ''[[Kid Colt, Outlaw]]'') was among the very few titles published continuously by Marvel from the 1940s [[Golden Age of Comic Books]], through Marvel's 1950s iteration as [[Atlas Comics (1950s)|Atlas Comics]], and into the 1960s [[Silver Age of Comic Books]].

Future ''[[Mad Magazine]]'' [[cartoonist]] and "Fold-In" creator [[Al Jaffee]] wrote and drew most of the early issues, several of which included ''Mad'' founding editor [[Harvey Kurtzman]]'s highly stylized "Hey Look!" one-page humor strips. Jaffee was succeeded by [[Al Hartley]], who would go on to [[Archie Comics]] and produce many [[Spire Christian Comics|Christian comic books]] starring Archie characters and others.  [[Morris Weiss]] drew ''Patsy and Her Pals''.  Millie (the Model) Collins made guest appearances in #92 and 98.

Following Patsy's high-school graduation, in issue #116 (Aug. 1964), the title switched from humor to become a young career-gal romantic adventure.  ''Patsy Walker'' lasted through issue #124 (Dec. 1965), with ''Patsy and Hedy'' outlasting it to its own #110 (Feb. 1967).

Patsy and Hedy made a cameo appearance in ''[[Fantastic Four]] [[annual publication|Annual]]'' #3 (1965), establishing them in the [[Marvel Universe]]. The superhero-team comic ''[[The Defenders (comic book)|The Defenders]]'' #89 (Nov. 1980) further established that the earlier stories were fictional works published within the fictional Marvel Universe itself, and written by Patsy's mother Dorothy Walker though based upon Patsy's own life and friends.<ref>{{cite journal|last= Miller|first= Jonathan|title= Beware the Claws of Patsy Walker: The Hellcat Cometh|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= 40|page= 66|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|date= May 2010}}</ref> The Patsy Walker profile in ''Marvel Legacy: The 1960s Handbook'' #1 (2006) establishes that Walker indeed experienced many of the events from these stories.

''Patsy Walker'' #95 and the [[science-fiction]] anthology ''[[Journey into Mystery]]'' #69 (both June 1961) are the first modern comic books labeled "Marvel Comics", with each showing an "MC" box on its cover.<ref>[http://www.comics.org/brand/36/ Marvel : MC (Brand)] at the Grand Comics Database.</ref>

===Hellcat===
The [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] feature in ''[[Amazing Adventures]]'' vol. 2, #13 (July 1972) introduced the concept of Walker as a superheroine. Writer [[Steve Englehart]] recalled that Walker's cameo in ''Fantastic Four Annual'' #3 had
{{blockquote|struck my fan's eye by including her in the Marvel Universe. ...I thought it would be cool to bring her in as a real character, with things to do. Part of my 'training' as a Marvel writer was writing romance stories and [[Western comics|Westerns]], but ''Patsy [Walker]'' was defunct as a comic by the time I got there.... Still, as a fan, I had collected everything Marvel, including ''Patsy Walker'' and ''Patsy and Hedy'' ... so I knew them as characters....<ref>Englehart in Miller, p. 62</ref>}}

Because the Beast feature was dropped from ''Amazing Adventures'' just three issues later, the storyline with Patsy Walker was temporarily abandoned.<ref>{{cite journal|last=DeAngelo|first=Daniel|date=July 2013|title=The Not-Ready-For-Super-Team Players: A History of the Defenders|journal=[[Back Issue!]]|issue=65|page=9 |publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref> Walker was reintroduced in ''[[The Avengers (comic book)|The Avengers]]'' #141 (Nov. 1975), having resumed her maiden name of Walker, and accompanied the Avengers on a couple of adventures. Shortly thereafter in ''The Avengers'' #144 (Feb. 1976), she adopted the name Hellcat, taking on superheroine [[Tigra|Greer Grant Nelson]]'s costume from her discontinued identity as The Cat. The name "Hellcat" itself had originally been proposed for Nelson.<ref>{{cite journal|last= Cassell|first= Dewey|date= August 2006|title= Talking About Tigra: From the Cat to Were-Woman|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= 17|pages= 26–33|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref> The suit's look was later adapted slightly.

Recalled Englehart in 2010,
{{blockquote|I wasn't real interested in the Cat. I read the books and they seemed like pandering, frankly — not very good stories written to appeal to a demographic. Once [Patsy] entered the [Marvel Universe], met the Beast, confronted her husband — all that began to change the Patsy I had inherited to someone a little more savvy. By the time she became the Hellcat, she could stand back far enough to see the ironies in her taking over a feminist creation. But she was really more about jumping into the superhero pool than standing back.... She didn't muse on the irony; she wanted to be a heroine.<ref>Englehart in Miller, p. 63</ref>}}
[[Image:Avengers 144.jpg|thumb|left|Patsy Walker becomes Hellcat in ''The Avengers'' #144 (Feb. 1976)]]

Hellcat joined the superhero team ''[[Defenders (comics)|The Defenders]]'' in issue #44 (Feb. 1977). After many adventures with the group, she met the supernatural adventurer [[Daimon Hellstrom]], the Son of [[Satan]], in ''The Defenders'' #92 (Feb. 1981). They marry in ''The Defenders'' #125 and become husband-and-wife occult investigators, but Hellstrom's demonic nature asserts itself, and Walker is driven first mad and then, in ''Hellstorm: Prince of Lies'' #14 (May 1994), to [[suicide]]. Through Hellstrom's manipulation of the superhero [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]], she was resurrected, in ''[[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts 2000]]'', a summer Annual of the superhero-team comic ''Thunderbolts'', and returned to Earth with new abilities acquired while in [[Hell]]. (The story which began in ''[[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts 2000]]'' concluded in ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers 2000]]''.) A three-issue ''Hellcat'' (Sept. – Nov. 2000) series takes place immediately following the events in the Thunderbolts and Avengers 2000 Annuals. Briefly adopting a new costume and then returning to her traditional yellow outfit, she rejoined the Defenders in a short-lived revival series, ''The Defenders'' vol. 2, #1–12 (March 2001 – Feb. 2002).

After appearing in occasional guest roles, Hellcat had starring roles between 2007 and 2009 thanks to artist [[Stuart Immonen]] and his writer wife [[Kathryn Immonen|Kathryn]]. With the impending relaunch of ''[[Marvel Comics Presents]]'', Stuart was asked by editor Nick Lowe if he wanted to do a Hellcat story, which was spread across the title's first four issues (Sept. – Dec. 2007). Marvel remained open for Hellcat [[miniseries]], and out of what Kathryn first conceived as a "Hellcat Christmas Special", inspired by [[Endurance racing (motorsport)|endurance car races]] in [[Mongolia]] and research on the [[Inuit]], came the five part series ''Patsy Walker: Hellcat'' (Sept. 2008 – Feb. 2009), drawn by [[David Lafuente]] with covers by Stuart. A tie-in to the [[Avengers: The Initiative|Avengers 50 State Initiative]], it features Hellcat being assigned to watch over [[Alaska]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicsreporter.com/index.php/cr_sunday_interview_kathryn_immonen/|title=CR Sunday Interview: Kathryn Immonen | author=Spurgeon,Tom  | date=2008-11-30|publisher=Comics Reporter|accessdate=2009-04-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbr.com/northern-exposure-immonen-talks-patsy-walker-hellcat/|title=Northern Exposure: Immonen talks "Patsy Walker: Hellcat"| author=Richards, Dave | date=2008-10-06|publisher=Comics Book Resources|accessdate=2009-04-10}}</ref> Following this, she was an ensemble star and narrator, alongside the superheroines [[Firestar]], [[Black Cat (comics)|Black Cat]], and [[Monica Rambeau|Photon]], in the miniseries ''[[Marvel Divas]]'' #1–4 (Sept.-Dec. 2009), which writers [[Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa]] and Tonci Zonjic had pitched it to Marvel editors as "''[[Sex and the City]]'' in the Marvel Universe".<ref name="marveldivas">{{cite web | url = http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendId=92159514&blogId=482150960 | title = MyCup o' Tea | first = Dan | last = Abnett | first2 = Andy | last2 = Lanning | authorlink = Dan Abnett | authorlink2 = Andy Lanning | date = 2009-04-09 | publisher = MySpace Comic Books | accessdate = 2009-04-10 | archivedate = 13 April 2009 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090413195242/http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendId=92159514&blogId=482150960 | df =  }}</ref>

Walker became part of [[All-New Marvel NOW!]] in ''[[She-Hulk]]'' #1, when Jennifer Walters starts her own law firm. Walters hires Patsy as her private investigator, who uses her Hellcat alias on assignments.<ref>''She-Hulk'' #1 (Vol. 3)</ref>

The [[All-New, All-Different Marvel]] line in 2015 led to a new ongoing Patsy Walker title, ''Patsy Walker A.K.A. Hellcat!''. Written by [[Kate Leth]] and drawn by [[Brittney Williams]], it attempts to combine the romance and superhero comics with a more comedic approach, which Leth compared to a [[Saturday-morning cartoon]].<ref>[http://marvel.com/news/comics/25072/get_familiar_with_patsy_walker_aka_hellcat Get Familiar with Patsy Walker, AKA Hellcat!]</ref><ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/article/leth-williams-get-their-claws-into-patsy-walker-aka-hellcat Leth & Williams Get Their Claws Into "Patsy Walker AKA Hellcat!"]</ref> In it, Walker tries to establish a job agency for superpowered people following her dismissal by She-Hulk, and also recover the rights to old ''Patsy Walker'' comics which have been republished by Hedy. In February 2017, Leth announced that the series would be ending that April with its 17th issue. She praised Marvel for "giv[ing] us space to wrap up the story exactly how we wanted in 3 volumes."<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbr.com/patsy-walker-aka-hellcat-series-finale/|title=Marvel's Patsy Walker, AKA Hellcat Series Ending In April|last=White|first=Brett|date=2017-02-21|work=CBR|access-date=2017-03-27|language=en-US}}</ref>

{{plot|date=October 2016}}
After growing up in suburban Centerville, graduating high school and marrying high-school sweetheart Robert "Buzz" Baxter, Patsy Walker becomes an assistant to scientist [[Hank McCoy]], the mutant superhero the Beast, who at that time was on hiatus from the [[X-Men]].

The two then retire from superheroics.<ref>''The Defenders'' #125 (November 1983)</ref>  Ultimately, Hellstrom's demonic inheritance took possession of him and drove Walker insane. Institutionalized, she was driven to suicide by the otherworldly being [[Deathurge]].<ref>''Hellstorm: Prince of Lies'' #1–14 (1993)</ref>

Trapped in Hell, Walker's spirit is used in a series of gladiatorial-like combat scenarios. There, she learns to develop and use her psychic powers. Hellstrom tricks the archer superhero Hawkeye into returning her spirit to Earth; Hawkeye believes he is retrieving his presumed-dead wife, [[Mockingbird (Marvel Comics)|Mockingbird]], from the demonic lord [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]]'s realm.<ref>''Thunderbolts Annual 2000'' (May 2000)</ref> Resurrected and back on Earth, Walker retains the powers she developed in Hell. Now able to manifest a costume at will, Walker adopts a reversed version of the Cat costume, with a blue cat-suit and cowl with yellow gloves and boots.{{issue|date=April 2013}} In this new guise, and once again a member of the Defenders, Hellcat focuses on combating [[occult]] evils, notably [[Nicholas Scratch]], who had based himself in her hometown of Centerville,{{issue|date=April 2013}} and the otherdimensional ruler [[Dormammu]].{{issue|date=April 2013}}

During the ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'' storyline, Hellcat willingly registers.<ref>''She-Hulk'' Vol 2 #10</ref> She serves as one of the young superheroes' instructors at [[Camp Hammond (comics)|Camp Hammond]].<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #10</ref> She was then assigned as the [[Avengers: The Initiative|Avengers 50 State Initiative]] official superhero for [[Alaska]],<ref>''Patsy Walker: Hellcat'' #1–5</ref> but eventually returned to [[New York City]].<ref>''[[Marvel Divas]]'' #1–4</ref> Hellcat develops and maintains a deep friendship with the superheroes [[Firestar]], [[Black Cat (comics)|Black Cat]] and [[Monica Rambeau]].

Hellcat is later seen with [[She-Hulk]] and facing personal problems. After a night of heavy drinking and partying, Hellcat and She-Hulk invade a warehouse that [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]] was using as a hideout and defeat two agents wearing high tech suits. She-Hulk then hires Hellcat as her private investigator to help with her economical situation.<ref>''She-Hulk'' Vol. 3 #2</ref> She then helps She-Hulk in protecting [[Kristoff Vernard]], the son of [[Doctor Doom]], who was trying to defect to the US.<ref>''She-Hulk'' Vol. 3 #3</ref> She's later seen talking with [[Tigra]] about a case involving a lawsuit but ends up fighting her when she mentions the plaintiff's name, George Saywitz.<ref>''She-Hulk'' Vol. 3 #5</ref> After recovering in a hospital,<ref>''She-Hulk'' Vol. 3 #6</ref> she helps She-Hulk and [[Hank Pym]] in a recovery mission to save Reza, the partner of inventor Rufus Randall, to settle an argument between them over a device known as the Shrinko, which they were planning to sell to Pym.<ref>''She-Hulk'' Vol. 3 #7</ref> They later wind up helping Steve Rogers, the original [[Captain America]], with a lawsuit involving a murder that happened in 1940.<ref>''She-Hulk'' Vol. 3 #8–9</ref>

As part of the ''[[All-New, All-Different Marvel]]'', She-Hulk eventually gets unable to afford Hellcat as an investigator and fires her friend, which also forces Walker to move out of Walters' office building (the same place where [[Howard the Duck]] works). Walker moves to the Brooklyn apartment of Ian, an [[Inhumans|Inhuman]] who she met when he used his powers to steal from an armored truck. Ian gets a job with Walker's old friend Tom Hale (known as "Tubs" in the romance comics) and inspires her to open a work agency for other superpowered people. Walker also learns that old rival Hedy Wolfe has republished the ''Patsy Walker'' comics (she got the rights from Walker's late mother Dorothy), to her chagrin, particularly given nostalgia made them successful. With the help of [[She-Hulk]] and [[Jessica Jones]], Walker gets the rights back by proving Dorothy was sedated and thus [[Capacity (law)|not in full mental capacities]] when she signed the comics off to Hedy, making it a [[void contract]].<ref>''Patsy Walker A.K.A. Hellcat!'' #1–7</ref>

During the ''[[Civil War II]]'' storyline, Patsy Walker hears about what happened to [[She-Hulk]]. [[Miss America (America Chavez)|Miss America]] does allow Patsy Walker to visit She-Hulk who is in a coma at the [[Triskelion (comics)|Triskelion]]. After the visit, Patsy Walker tells Howard the Duck and the other tenants about She-Hulk's current condition, and moves her offices to where Jennifer operated as a lawyer.<ref>''Patsy Walker A.K.A. Hellcat!'' #8</ref>

Afterwards, Hedy dupes Patsy's ex-husbands Mad-Dog and Daimon Hellstrom into fighting her. Daimon sends Patsy to a dimension ruled by the demon [[Belial]], who tries to bring Hellcat to his side.<ref>''Patsy Walker A.K.A. Hellcat!'' #9–10</ref> Patsy then confronts her former friend Black Cat, now leading a gang of criminals.<ref>''Patsy Walker A.K.A. Hellcat!'' #11–14</ref> Patsy suddenly catches a cold that causes her to alter reality when she sneezes. After several disasters, Patsy accidentally makes a building disappear. Hedy then calls Patsy and reveals that she's dating the demon Belial, who helps Patsy overcome her grief over She-Hulk and cures her of the cold.<ref>''Patsy Walker A.K.A. Hellcat!'' #15–16</ref> Patsy then receives a check for a big amount of money from She-Hulk and takes Ian, Tom and Jubilee to the mall. While shopping, they encounter two teenage girls, pretending to be supervillains, who are revealed to be Patsy's biggest fans. Ian then figures out that the girls like each other and resolves their dispute. After that, Patsy expresses joy of how her life has changed.<ref>''Patsy Walker A.K.A. Hellcat!'' #17</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Hellcat can sense mystical phenomena or those items or persons touched by mystical energy. She can use a force field that deflects mystical attacks and is able to summon her costume at will. She also possesses retractable claws and grappling hooks on her wrists. Patsy is also a well-trained martial artist and gymnast, having been taught by [[Captain America]], Beast and Moondragon.

==Other versions==
===Ultimate Marvel===
[[Image:ULTMTSV2006 COV.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Cover to ''Ultimate New Ultimates'' #1. Art by Leinil Francis Yu.]]
Patsy Walker has appeared in Marvel Comics' [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|Multiverse]] [[Ultimate Marvel]] [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]]. In ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]'', she first appears as a spokeswoman for a security firm (#11), then as a swimsuit model for ''[[Maxim (magazine)|Maxim]]'' magazine (#14), a talk show hostess, presenting a biography on [[Alternative versions of Doctor Strange#Ultimate Doctor Strange|Doctor Strange]] (#70), and finally interviewing [[Alternative versions of the Green Goblin#Ultimate Marvel|Norman Osborn]] (#113). In addition she appeared in ''Ultimate Marvel Team-up'', hosting an instructional video for the Baxter Building, although this issue is not necessarily canonical.{{Issue|date=June 2009}} Patsy assumes her Hellcat identity in [[Ultimates]] and was a founding member of the ill-fated [[Defenders (comics)#Ultimate Defenders|Defenders]]. Additionally, [[Alternative versions of Kitty Pryde#Ultimate Shadowcat|Kitty Pryde]] has (within the pages of ''Ultimate Spider-Man'') constructed a costume visually similar to the 616 Hellcat's, differing in color and mask design only. Walker later shows up in ''[[Ultimate Comics: New Ultimates]]'', apparently powered up from a [[Loki (Marvel Comics)|mysterious source]].<ref>''New Ultimates'' #1</ref>

===Heroes Reborn===
In the [[Heroes Reborn (comics)|Heroes Reborn]] universe, Hellcat appears as a member of the Avengers. This version of the character sports a more bestial, "[[werecat]]" appearance, similar to Tigra. Envious of [[Scarlet Witch]]'s beauty, she is manipulated by [[Loki (comics)|Loki]] into siding with [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]] against the rest of the team. Patsy takes possession of Scarlet Witch's body, but is killed after [[Agatha Harkness]] forcibly expels her essence.<ref>''Avengers'' (vol. 2) #1–11</ref>
