'''Ghost Rider''' is the name of many [[fictional character|fictional]] [[supernatural]] [[antihero]]es appearing in [[American comic books]] published by [[Marvel Comics]].  Marvel had previously used the name for a [[Western comics|Western]] character whose name was later changed to '''[[Phantom Rider]]'''.

The first [[supernatural]] Ghost Rider is [[stunt]] [[motorcycle|motorcyclist]] '''[[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|Johnny Blaze]]''', who, in order to save the life of his father, agreed to give his soul to "[[Satan]]" (later revealed to be an arch-demon named [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]]). At night and when around evil, Blaze finds his flesh consumed by hellfire, causing his head to become a flaming skull. He rides a fiery motorcycle and wields blasts of hellfire from his body, usually from his skeletal hands. He eventually learns he has been bonded with the demon [[Zarathos]]. Blaze starred in the ''[[Ghost Rider (comic book)|Ghost Rider]]'' series from 1972 to 1983. The subsequent ''Ghost Rider'' series (1990–1998) featured '''[[Ghost Rider (Danny Ketch)|Danny Ketch]]''' as a new Ghost Rider. After his sister was injured by [[ninja]] [[gangster]]s, Ketch came in contact with a motorcycle that had somehow been mystically enchanted to contain the essence of a Spirit of Vengeance. Blaze reappeared in this 1990s series as a [[supporting character]], and it was later revealed that Danny and his sister were Johnny Blaze's long lost siblings. In 2000s comics, Blaze again became the Ghost Rider, succeeding Ketch. In 2013, '''[[Ghost Rider (Robbie Reyes)|Robbie Reyes]]''' became Ghost Rider as part of the [[Marvel NOW!]] initiative.

[[Nicolas Cage]] starred as the Johnny Blaze iteration of the character in the 2007 film ''[[Ghost Rider (film)|Ghost Rider]]'' and the sequel ''[[Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance]]'' in 2012. [[Gabriel Luna]] plays the Robbie Reyes version in the television series ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'' The actors [[Henry Simmons]] and [[Clark Gregg]] also play Ghost Rider briefly.

==Fictional character biography==

===Johnny Blaze===
{{main article|Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)}}
Following the [[Phantom Rider|western comics character]] who originally used the name, the first superhero Ghost Rider, '''Johnny Blaze''', debuted in ''[[Marvel Spotlight]]'' #5 (Aug. 1972), created by writer-editor [[Roy Thomas]], writer [[Gary Friedrich]], and artist [[Mike Ploog]]. He received his own series in 1973, with [[penciller]] [[Jim Mooney]] handling most of the first nine issues. Several different creative teams mixed-and-matched until penciller [[Don Perlin]] began a considerably long stint with issue #26, eventually joined by writer [[Michael Fleisher]] through issue #58. The series ran through in issue #81 (June 1983). Blaze returned as Ghost Rider in a 2001 six-issue miniseries written by [[Devin Grayson]]; a second miniseries written by [[Garth Ennis]] in 2005, and an ongoing monthly series that began publication in July 2006. Johnny Blaze was the son of Naomi Blaze and Barton Blaze, Naomi being the previous Ghost Rider.

===Danny Ketch===
{{main article|Ghost Rider (Danny Ketch)}}
The next Ghost Rider, a young man named '''Daniel "Danny" Ketch''' (Johnny Blaze's long lost little brother), debuted in ''Ghost Rider'' vol. 3, #1 (May 1990). This Ghost Rider was nearly identical to the previous, although his costume was now a black leather [[leather jacket|biker jacket]] with spiked shoulder-pads, grey leather pants, and a mystic chain he wore across his chest, which responded to his mental commands and served as his primary melee weapon. His new motorcycle resembled a futuristic machine and the front of it could lower to serve as a battering ram. Like the original Ghost Rider's bike, the wheels were composed of mystic hellfire. Unlike the relationship between the previous Ghost Rider and the demon with which he was bonded, Ketch and his demon—who in vol. 2, #91 (December 1997) is revealed to be Marvel's incarnation of the Angel of Death/Judgment—are cooperative with each other. At the close of the series with vol. 2, #93 (Feb. 1998), Ketch apparently died. The following year, however, ''[[Peter Parker: Spider-Man#Volume One (1990-1998)|Peter Parker: Spider-Man]]'' #93 (July 1999) revealed Ketch was still alive. Nearly a decade later, Marvel published the long-completed final issue as ''Ghost Rider Finale'' (Jan. 2007), which reprints the last issue and the previously unpublished #94.<ref>While the [[trademarked]] cover logo reads ''Ghost Rider'' #94, the comic's postal [[indicia (publishing)|indicia]] lists the comic [[copyrighted]] as ''Ghost Rider Finale''.</ref>

===Alejandra Jones===
During the [[2011 in comics|2011]] [[fictional crossover|crossover]] story arc ''[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]'', in several Marvel Comics titles, a Nicaraguan woman named '''Alejandra Jones''' becomes Ghost Rider through a ritual performed by a man named Adam, in ''Ghost Rider'' vol. 4, #1. Though she demonstrated many previously unknown powers of the Ghost Rider entity, she was deprived of its full power when Johnny Blaze took back most of this power.

===Robbie Reyes===
{{main article|Ghost Rider (Robbie Reyes)}}
In March 2014, a new ''Ghost Rider'' series debuted featuring a new [[Mexican-American]]<ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=59484]</ref> character named '''Roberto "Robbie" Reyes''', taking on the mantle. He drives a black classic muscle car reminiscent of a modified [[1969 Dodge Charger]] instead of a motorcycle and lives in [[East Los Angeles, California|East Los Angeles]]. The character debuted in 2013.<ref>Montgomery (October 13, 2013).

==Powers and abilities==
The Ghost Rider is a human who can transform into a skeletal superhuman wreathed in ethereal flame and given supernatural powers. The motorcycles he rides can travel faster than any conventional vehicle and can perform such seemingly impossible feats as riding up a vertical surface, across water surfaces and leaping across great distances that normal motorcycles cannot. The Ghost Riders are virtually indestructible and notoriously hard to injure by any conventional means, as bullets and knives usually pass through them without causing pain (knives are seen to melt while in their body).<ref>''[[Ghost Rider (2007 film)]]''</ref> It is possible that they are genuinely immortal, as it is said that God created them and only God can destroy them.<ref>''Ghost Riders: Heavens On Fire'' #6</ref> Despite being composed of bone and hellfire, the Ghost Riders possess formidable superhuman strength, enough to easily pick up a truck and hurl it across a road. It has been stated that Johnny Blaze as Ghost Rider can press around 25 tons (50,000&nbsp; lbs)  (or more as seen in [[World War Hulk]]).<ref>''All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z'' #4</ref>

Each Ghost Rider entity also had abilities specific to him or her.

; [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|Johnny Blaze]]: Originally when Blaze transformed into Ghost Rider, his body changed but not the clothes he was wearing. In his new incarnation, this is different and his clothes take on a different appearance with a spiked leather jacket and chains. As Ghost Rider, he can cause his motorcycle to transform and surround itself with hellfire or he can create a new cycle from pure hellfire. He is also capable of projecting hellfire as a weapon. Hellfire "burns the soul" without leaving physical injuries on the victim and its effects have been seen as similar to the "Penance Stare." In his new incarnation, Blaze is now possibly the most powerful hero on Earth. During "World War Hulk", it was stated by [[Doctor Strange]] that Ghost Rider might be equally as powerful as the "Green Scar" persona of [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] and could possibly defeat him. During this series, Dr. Strange states that Ghost Rider protects only the innocent, which none of the Illuminati are. In recent comics Blaze's Ghost Rider has been given the "Penance Stare" and mystical chain, both of which were specific to the Danny Ketch Ghost Rider. Blaze also uses a shotgun and discovered that he can discharge Hellfire from the weapon when he first encountered Ketch. He also now has new abilities including hellfire breath and the ability to produce chains from either his throat or chest. He is also now able to travel between the incorporeal realms.

; [[Ghost Rider (Danny Ketch)|Danny Ketch]]: When Ketch transformed into Ghost Rider, his clothes changed with him, taking on the appearance of a spiked leather jacket with chains, gray leather pants and spiked gloves and boots. Likewise, his motorcycle underwent a radical transformation, changing from a conventional into a high-tech motorcycle (this transformation was not strictly limited to the motorcycle he found in the cemetery as he was once seen to be able to transform another cycle in "Ghost Rider/Wolverine/Punisher: Hearts of Darkness"). Along with flaming wheels that allow the bike to nearly fly across surfaces, the bike included a shield-like battering ram on the front. As the Ghost Rider, Ketch used a mystical chain which responded to his mental commands. It could grow in length, alter direction while in the air, stiffen into a staff or spear, and separate into several links which can strike like shrapnel and then return to their original form. Daniel's most famous power was the ''Penance Stare.'' By locking eyes with a target and mentally focusing, the Danny Ketch Ghost Rider was able to make the target experience all the pain they had ever inflicted on anyone else. Some beings have shown resistance to this ability, such as [[Venom (comics)|Venom]] and [[Carnage (comics)|Carnage]] as their alien [[symbiote (comics)|symbiote]] "costumes" do not technically have eyes; and [[Madcap (comics)|Madcap]] who is so [[Sadomasochism|masochistic]] he claims to enjoy the experience. In the 1994 Fantastic Four animated series, this ability was shown to be powerful enough to bring down the mighty Galactus, as Ghost Rider forced Galactus to feel the pain of all those who had died as a result of his feeding on their planets. As Ghost Rider put it "A billion souls". This display of power, though,  appeared to simply be a rewrite for the animated series, as the original storyline in Fantastic Four issue 243, has Doctor Strange casting a spell that causes all of the souls of those Galactus has killed by his feedings to be visited upon him, at once. Originally, this incarnation of the Ghost Rider could only be summoned if Danny was present when "innocent blood was spilled" (an innocent simply being threatened was not enough), at which time Danny had to touch the gas cap of his motorcycle for the transformation process to occur. Later, he was able to summon the Ghost Rider without touching the gas cap but still needed to wait for the innocent blood to be spilled. Later still, he was able to summon the Ghost Rider by willpower alone.

; [[Ghost Rider (Robbie Reyes)|Robbie Reyes]]: The ghost of Eli Morrow that inhabits Robbie's body is not, according to Johnny Blaze, a true Spirit of Vengeance. Regardless, he gives Robbie several abilities similar to that of other Ghost Riders, including the power to manifest and control chains ending in thin knives or sickles.<ref>''All New Ghost Rider'' #5</ref> The black muscle car that Morrow's ghost initially inhabits is linked to the Ghost Rider, allowing Robbie in his Ghost Rider form to instantly teleport to and/or merge with the car. The car can also be driven remotely, and Robbie's Ghost Rider form can pass harmlessly through it, allowing it to drive into foes. The car's trunk, when opened, acts as a portal, allowing the Ghost Rider to transport anything, including people, to any location. Though it is initially unknown if Robbie's Ghost Rider form possesses the divine powers of his predecessors, he eventually displays the ability to use the Penance Stare during a battle with [[Star Brand]]. <ref>''Marvel Legacy'' #1</ref> Eli is able to take full control of Robbie's body when the teen gives in to his negative emotions, signified by a pallid skin tone and both of his eyes turning orange. His Ghost Rider form also displays the ability to change into a more powerful and demonic form when Robbie is sufficiently angered. <ref>''Robbie Reyes: Ghost Rider'' #5</ref>

==Other Spirits of Vengeance==

===Vengeance===
{{main article|Vengeance (comics)}}
'''Michael Badilino''', an ex-member of the [[New York City Police Department]], is one-third of an "Organic Medallion of Power"; the other two are Ketch and Blaze (the Medallion itself was never explained in any true detail). He possesses powers more in line with those of the Zarathos version of Ghost Rider, although he also possesses the Penance Stare and his motorcycle seemed to share characteristics with the Noble Kale version. His appearance is distinguished by a deep purple skull, large fangs protruding from his upper jaw, and backswept curved horns on the top of his skull.

In his superhuman form, Badilino was called '''Vengeance''', and originally attempted to kill the Ghost Rider, believing him to be Zarathos. Vengeance later became the ally of Ghost Rider and Johnny Blaze. Vengeance would also take on the role of the Ghost Rider and even semi-seriously referred to himself by that name when confronted by Spider-Man shortly after the apparent death of Ghost Rider in battle with Zarathos and acolytes The Fallen. Vengeance killed himself, along with the villain Hellgate, by triggering a massive explosion through his Hellfire, the source of the mystical flames that encompass the bones of both Vengeance and Ghost Rider.

Vengeance reappears in the last four issues of ''Ghost Rider'' vol. 2, involved in [[Blackheart]]'s plans to kill Noble Kale. Vengeance aids the Ghost Rider in the ensuing battle, destroying Blackheart and ruling Hell during Ketch's absences.

===The Last Stand of the Spirits of Vengeance===
Seven riders show their flaming heads for the first time in this story arc by writer Jason Aaron and artist Tan Eng Huat.  Daniel Ketch returns with a new mission: to collect the powers of all the Ghost Riders for the angel Zadkiel to prevent the corruption of the powers with their human hosts. Zadkiel has other motives he keeps to himself, of which he needs the powers of the riders to tear down the walls of New Jerusalem and wage war on the heavens.

===''Trail of Tears''===
A version of Ghost Rider appeared in the [[Limited series (comics)|miniseries]] ''Ghost Rider: Trail of Tears'' #1–6 (April–Sept. 2007) by writer [[Garth Ennis]] and artist [[Clayton Crain]]. Set during the [[American Civil War]], it finds Confederate officer '''Travis Parham''' avenging the murders of his friend, an ex-slave named Caleb and Caleb's family. Parham meets a horse-riding Ghost Rider who seeks the same men. Eventually, Parham learns about the deaths instrumental in helping set forth the Spirit of Vengeance.

* In October 2016, Luna discussed that there are plans for Reyes to feature in his own television series, following his introduction in ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.''.<ref>[http://www.ign.com/videos/2016/10/08/ghost-rider-actor-says-there-are-rumblings-hell-get-his-own-show-nycc-2016]</ref> In later interviews the actor stated he hopes [[Norman Reedus]] would portray Johnny Blaze in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.<ref>http://screenrant.com/agents-of-shields-gabriel-luna-norman-reedus-johnny-blaze/</ref>

====Animation====
* In the ''[[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men: The Animated Series]]'' first-season finale, [[Professor X]] scans [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]]'s memories and sees Ghost Rider, apparently approaching Gambit.
* The Danny Ketch version of Ghost Rider appeared in the ''[[Fantastic Four (1994 TV series)|Fantastic Four]]'' episode "When Calls Galactus" voiced by [[Richard Grieco]]. He helps the Fantastic Four and Thor when Galactus plans to feed on Earth.
* The Danny Ketch version of Ghost Rider appears in ''[[The Incredible Hulk (1996 TV series)|Incredible Hulk]]'' animated series on [[United Paramount Network|UPN]], voiced by Richard Grieco.
** It was due to his usage on the UPN cartoons that caused a planned appearance on ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'' to be rejected. The episode would have pitted Ghost Rider and Spider-Man against [[Mysterio]] and [[Dormammu]].<ref>http://members.aol.com/drg4/semper.html</ref> Allegedly, these two appearances were also meant to serve as a [[backdoor pilot]] for a potential "Ghost Rider" animated series.<ref>http://marvel.toonzone.net/retrospective/ghostrider/</ref><ref>http://www.tv.com/shows/the-incredible-hulk-1996/innocent-blood-117316/</ref>
* The Johnny Blaze version of Ghost Rider appears in the ''[[Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H.]]'' episode "Spirit of Vengeance", voiced by [[Fred Tatasciore]].<ref>{{cite episode|title=Spirit of Vengeance|series=Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H.|network=Disney XD|season=2|number=24|airdate=June 14, 2015}}</ref> This version is able to haunt and take control vehicles of all sizes, visualized by the vehicles catching fire and allowing weapons, such as some tanks he took over, to shoot fireballs. Unlike other versions of the Ghost Rider, this one could generate electricity and lightning from blue fire, as well as create a vortex of lightning that cured Abomination of his gamma and transformed him back into a human. However, like other versions, this one was able to make portals to other dimensions to appear on walls and other surfaces, such as a mountainside.

===Film===
* On February 16, 2007, [[Columbia Pictures]] released the movie ''[[Ghost Rider (film)|Ghost Rider]]'', starring [[Nicolas Cage]] as the adult Johnny Blaze and [[Matt Long]] as a teen. The character faces [[Blackheart]] and his father, [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephistopheles]].
* Nicolas Cage reprised the role in a sequel, ''[[Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance]]'', released February 17, 2012 in [[3-D film|3-D]].

* In May 2013, the film rights to Ghost Rider reverted to [[Marvel Studios]] from [[Sony Pictures Entertainment|Sony Pictures]], although it was also confirmed that there were no immediate plans to produce another film featuring the character in the immediate future.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://screenrant.com/ghost-rider-movie-rights-marvel-punisher-blade-daredevil/ |title='Ghost Rider' Movie Rights Return to Marvel – Will We See a Reboot Soon? |work=screenrant.com |date=2013-05-02 |accessdate=2013-05-30}}</ref>
