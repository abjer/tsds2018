==Publication history==
Misty Knight was first mentioned in ''[[Marvel Premiere]]'' #20 (January 1975) and was created by writer [[Tony Isabella]] with artist [[Arvell Jones]].

==Powers and abilities==
Misty Knight is a highly skilled combatant who in addition to her police combat training is proficient in [[martial arts]] and possesses near-perfect aim with firearms. She is also a superb detective, having graduated at the top of her class at the police academy and earned a degree in criminology from the [[John Jay College of Criminal Justice]].<ref>''Iron Fist'', vol. 1 #7</ref> Her bionic arm is superhumanly strong, and she can punch a target with incredible force, or crush objects as tough as steel in her vise-like grip. However, since the rest of her body is not cybernetically enhanced, she cannot lift objects heavier than her back, shoulders, and legs can physically support. Her arm's advantages as a weapon are limited to kinetic crushing and impact forces.

Her original bionic right arm was constructed from steel, and designed by Stark International. Her new arm was built by [[Stark Industries]] and is an alloy of [[vibranium|Antarctic vibranium]] and [[diamond]]; at close range it can liquefy all known metals including [[adamantium]]. It is also now able to generate a wide anti-gravity repulsor field similar to [[Iron Man's armor]].<ref>''Daughters of the Dragon'' #6</ref>  It can also apparently release a concentrated beam of cryogenic energy, which can cover a target in a blanket of ice from a distance. This cold also seems to make the target much more fragile, allowing otherwise durable materials to be broken or rended when frozen.<ref>''Heroes for Hire'' #7 (2007)</ref> Iron Man revealed the arm also displays [[List of superhuman features and abilities in fiction#Technopathy|technopathic]] capabilities, teaching Misty how to control a horde of robots.<ref name="World War Hulk: Aftersmash #1"/> Following her "pregnancy", Danny Rand spent money on additional features to the arm, including magnetism and a concussive blast.<ref>''Shadowland: Blood on the Street'' #1-3</ref>
