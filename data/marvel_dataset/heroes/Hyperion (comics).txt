'''Hyperion''' is the name of a number of [[fictional character]]s appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The original Hyperion made his debut in ''[[The Avengers (comic book)|The Avengers]]'' #69 (Oct. 1969), created by writer [[Roy Thomas]] and artist [[Sal Buscema]]. Subsequently, Marvel has introduced various other versions of Hyperion, each originating in a different dimension of the [[Marvel Multiverse]], with seven distinct versions of the character to date - three supervillains belonging to the team [[Squadron Sinister]], another villain with greater power levels than all of the others, two heroes from [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universes]], and a zombified clone.

The first Hyperion, Zhib-Ran, was a member of [[Squadron Sinister]], gathered by the cosmic [[Grandmaster (comics)|Grandmaster]] to fight against a team of [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] gathered by the time travelling [[Kang (comics)|Kang]]. The group later returned to fight the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]] with the alien [[Nebulon (comics)|Nebulon]] granting them additional super powers. The original Hyperion later learns that he's a duplicate version of Hyperion of Earth-712 created by the Grandmaster. For a while he replaced the Earth-712 version, but ultimately dies fighting against the Earth-712 Hyperion. A different Hyperion later appears with the latest Squadron Sinister but is defeated by the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]].

Six years after the creation of the Squadron Sinister. Marvel created a heroic version of the team, the [[Squadron Supreme]] from the alternate dimension designated Earth-712. In this version Hyperion (Mark Milton) is a founding member of the Squadron Supreme, with the purpose of protecting the citizens of the United States. The Squadron Supreme came to the main Marvel earth (Earth-616) to fight the Squadron Sinister revealing their existence to members of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. The Squadron later takes control of the United States, believing they could keep everyone safer by taking control of the nation. The desire for peace and control leads several members of the Squadron to [[brainwashing|brainwash]] several super villains and others who oppose their rule that becomes more and more totalitarian in nature. After a battle that costs [[Nighthawk (Marvel Comics)#Kyle Richmond (Earth-712)|Nighthawk]] his life, Hyperion realizes the errors of their approach and relinquishes control of the country. When the Earth-712 universe is destroyed by the [[Nth Man]] the Squadron Supreme ends up stranded in the Earth-616 universe.

In 2003 Marvel Comics launched ''[[Squadron Supreme (Supreme Power)|Supreme Power]]'', a new take on the Squadron Supreme universe, designated Earth-31916, where Hyperion is an alien baby sent to earth from a dying planet. The origin mirrors that of Superman, but Hyperion is found and raised by the United States Government to be a super powered operative. He later turns on the government and helps establish Earth-31916's first super hero team. It appears as though this version of Hyperion was killed during Marvel's 2015 ''[[Secret Wars (2015)|Secret Wars]]'' storyline.

Other versions of Hyperion have been seen over the years, including the vastly powerful King Hyperion from an alternate universe, a Zombie version that shows up on Earth-616, an alternate reality Hyperion that first joined the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and later became a member of the Earth-616 version of the Squadron Supreme and Baron Hyperion that led a portion of ''[[Battleworld]]'' during ''Secret Wars'', fighting against several other versions of the Squadron Supreme/Squadron Sinister.

===Squadron Sinister (Earth-616)===
The first Hyperion in Marvel Comics debuted in the title ''[[The Avengers (comic book)|The Avengers]]''.<ref>''Avengers'' #69 (Oct. 1969)</ref> This story arc introduced the supervillain team the [[Squadron Sinister]], whose members were loosely based on heroes in [[DC Comics]]' [[Justice League of America]], with Hyperion based on [[Superman]].<ref>Interview with Roy Thomas and Jerry Bails in ''The Justice League Companion'' (2003) pp. 72–73</ref>

The Squadron Sinister are assembled by the cosmic entity the [[Grandmaster (comics)|Grandmaster]] to battle the champions of the time-traveling [[Kang (comics)|Kang]] - the superhero team the Avengers. The Avengers defeat the Squadron and thwart the Grandmaster, with the Thunder God [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] miniaturizing Hyperion and trapping him in a glass sphere.<ref>''Avengers'' #69 - 71 (Oct. - Dec. 1969)</ref> The Squadron reappear in the title [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]], reunited by the [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] [[Nebulon (comics)|Nebulon]]. The villains receive greater power in exchange for the planet Earth, and create a giant laser cannon in the [[Arctic]] to melt the [[polar ice caps]], thereby covering the entirety of the Earth's surface in water. The superhero team the Defenders prevent the scheme and defeat the villains (and Nebulon), with the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] overpowering Hyperion.<ref>''Defenders'' #13 - 14 (May - July 1974)</ref>

After this defeat Hyperion and his two remaining teammates are teleported off world by Nebulon, and later return to Earth. Acquiring an energy-draining weapon, the villains plan to threaten the Earth once again but are defeated by the Defenders and the Avenger [[Henry Pym|Yellowjacket]].<ref>''Giant-Size Defenders'' #4 (1974)</ref>

Hyperion has another brief encounter with several members of the Avengers, who seek a way to separate the Power Prism of [[Doctor Spectrum]] from fellow Avenger the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]].<ref>''Avengers'' Annual #8 (1978)</ref> The character battles Thor once again and encounters the Earth-712 version of Hyperion from the [[Squadron Supreme]].<ref name=Thor280>''Thor'' #280 (Feb. 1979)</ref> Hyperion is also involved with the warrior woman [[Thundra]], with the relationship ending when she discovers a means of returning to her own dimension.<ref>''Marvel Two-In-One'' #67 (Sep. 1980)</ref> In the Earth-712 universe Hyperion is told by the villain [[Master Menace]] that he is an inorganic duplicate created by the Grandmaster modeled on the Hyperion from that universe. A bitter Hyperion then impersonates the Squadron Supreme's version of Hyperion for several weeks before dying in battle against the original.<ref name="Squadron Supreme' 1986">''Squadron Supreme'' #8 (Apr. 1986)</ref> The Grandmaster briefly resurrects the character as part of the [[Legion of the Unliving]], a group created to combat the Avengers.<ref>''Avengers'' Annual #16 (Dec. 1987)</ref>

A new Hyperion is made when the Grandmaster later reappears and reforms the Squadron Sinister. Hyperion is joined by a new Doctor Spectrum ('''Alice Nugent''', former lab assistant of Henry Pym); the [[Whizzer (comics)|Whizzer]] (now called [[Speed Demon (comics)|Speed Demon]]) and Nighthawk. This Hyperion originated from the Microverse, like the original Sinister Hyperion claimed before learning his origins were a lie. Courtesy of a phenomenon known as the '''Wellspring of Power''' - an interdimensional source of superhuman abilities - the Grandmaster increases the Squadron Sinister's powers and they battle the New Thunderbolts. Thunderbolts team leader [[Baron Zemo]] defeats the Grandmaster, and in the ensuing chaos Hyperion and the members of the Squadron Sinister scatter and escape.<ref>''New Thunderbolts'' #15 - 16 (Jan. - Feb. 2006); ''Thunderbolts'' #102 - 108 (July 2006 - Jan. 2007)</ref>

===Squadron Supreme (Earth-712)===
{{see also|Squadron Supreme}}
Thomas and penciller John Buscema also created an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]] team of heroes called the Squadron Supreme in the title ''[[The Avengers (comic book)|The Avengers]]'',<ref>''Avengers'' #85 (Feb. 1971)</ref> using characters that shared names with those of the Squadron Sinister (this caused confusion in Marvel's production department, as the covers of ''Avengers'' #85 and #141 (Nov. 1975) claimed the issues featured appearances by the Squadron Sinister, when in fact it was the Squadron Supreme that appeared in both issues). The last known [[Eternal (comics)|Eternal]] left on Earth-712,<ref>''Quasar'' #16</ref> the character is a founding member of the Squadron Supreme and has a civilian identity, Mark Milton.

The Earth-712 Hyperion appears on every occasion with the Squadron Supreme, and the group first encounter beings from the [[Earth-616]] universe when four Avengers - the [[Vision (Marvel Comics)#Silver Age|Vision]]; [[Scarlet Witch]]; [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] and the second [[Hawkeye (comics)|Goliath]] - accidentally arrive. The Avengers first battle and then assist the Squadron Supreme against the global threat posed by the mutant [[Brain-Child]], before returning to their own universe.<ref>''Avengers'' #85 - 86 (Feb. - Mar. 1971)</ref>

Hyperion and the Squadron Supreme fall under control of the artifact the [[Serpent Crown]] and battle the Avengers in the Earth-616 universe before being freed;<ref>''Avengers'' #141 -144 (Nov. 1975 - Feb. 1976)</ref> encounter Thor when he battles the evil Hyperion <ref name=Thor280/> and enlists the aid of the Defenders against the villain the [[Overmind (comics)|Overmind]] and his ally [[Null, the Living Darkness]] when they threaten the Earth-712 universe.<ref>''Defenders'' #112 - 115 (Oct. 1982 - Jan. 1983)</ref>

In the 12-issue ''Squadron Supreme'' miniseries (Sept. 1985 - Aug. 1986) [[Mark Gruenwald]] picked up from where Earth-712 was last seen in ''Defenders'' #114 and revealed Hyperion's origin. In the miniseries, Hyperion and other Squadron members resolve - against the advice of [[Nighthawk (Marvel Comics)#Kyle Richmond (Earth-712)|Nighthawk]] - to assume control of the government of the [[United States]] on Earth-712. Hyperion helps establish the behavior modification program;<ref>''Squadron Supreme'' #2 (Oct. 1985)</ref> defeats and [[Brainwashing|brainwashes]] the [[Institute of Evil]];<ref>''Squadron Supreme'' #5 - 6 (Jan. - Feb. 1986)</ref> and is trapped in an inter-dimensional zone by the evil (Zhib-Ran) Hyperion. Forced to ally himself with Master Menace to escape, Hyperion battles Zhib-Ran to death and while victorious is blinded.<ref name="Squadron Supreme' 1986"/> After a battle to the death with Nighthawk and the [[America Redeemers|Redeemers]], a team formed to stop the domineering Squadron, Hyperion relents and relinquishes power.<ref>''Squadron Supreme'' #12 (Aug. 1986)</ref>

The character and the surviving members of the Squadron Supreme travel into space to protect their planet from the expanding [[Nth Man]], and are exiled to the Earth-616 universe.<ref>''Squadron Supreme: Death of a Universe'' (June 1989)</ref> The team encounters the hero [[Quasar (comics)|Quasar]], and take up residence at the government facility [[Project Pegasus]].<ref>''Quasar'' #13 (Aug. 1990)</ref> Quasar and the Eternal [[Makkari (comics)|Makkari]] rescue the Squadron when the team becomes captured by the [[Cosmic entities (Marvel Comics)|cosmic entity]] the [[Stranger (comics)|Stranger]].

===Supreme Power (Earth-31916)===
{{see also|Squadron Supreme (Supreme Power)}}
The mature-audience [[Marvel MAX]] imprint showcases the adventures of the Earth-31916 version of the Squadron Supreme. This Mark Milton was sent to Earth in a spacecraft, and seized shortly after by U.S. government agents who raised him in a tightly controlled, isolated environment and exposed him to frequent propaganda.<ref>''Supreme Power'' #1</ref> As an adult, he became a covert agent used in strict secrecy, but eventually a reporter came too close to the truth, and the decision was made to go public,<ref>''Supreme Power'' #3</ref> largely so he could be used as a distraction from the government's even more closely guarded secret super-operative, [[Doctor Spectrum#Joseph Ledger (Earth-31916)|Joe Ledger]].<ref>''Supreme Power'' #4</ref> He briefly teams with [[Nighthawk (Marvel Comics)#Kyle Richmond (Earth-31916)|Nighthawk]] and [[Blur (comics)|Blur]] to find and defeat the super-powered [[serial killer]] [[Redstone (comics)#Supreme Power|Michael Redstone]].<ref>''Supreme Power'' #12-14</ref> As Hyperion discovers that he has been systematically lied to,<ref>''Supreme Power #2-9</ref> he becomes disillusioned with his government and finally openly rebels.<ref>''Supreme Power'' #9</ref> When the government attempts to blackmail him into returning by revealing his alien status to the public, he responds by smashing into the [[North Pole]] from space, creating a [[Richter scale|10.5]] seismic event.<ref>''Supreme Power'' #18</ref><ref>''Supreme Power: Hyperion'' #1</ref>

In the ''Supreme Power: Hyperion'' miniseries, a hastily assembled team of superhumans is sent by the government to retrieve him, and the resulting battle—through an interaction of Hyperion's "flash vision" eye-beams, [[Nuke (Squadron Supreme)#Supreme Power|Nuke]]'s radiation blast, and [[Arcanna#Squadron Supreme (Earth-31916)|Arcanna]]'s reality manipulation—sends the combatants into a (seeming) [[alternate timeline]]<ref>''Supreme Power: Hyperion'' #2</ref> where Hyperion and the Squadron Supreme (consisting of several retrieval team members plus several previously unseen superhumans) rule a [[dystopian]] world, causing Hyperion on the advice of his otherworld counterpart<ref>''Supreme Power: Hyperion'' #4</ref> to rethink his ideas about power, humanity, and teamwork, leading him to surrender to the Squadron from his world.<ref>''Supreme Power: Hyperion'' #5</ref> It is only afterwards that [[Master Menace#Supreme Power|Emil Burbank]] deduces that it was not an alternate world they traveled to, but their own future; Burbank tells no one of his discovery.

===King Hyperion (Earth-4023)===
Another Hyperion, King Hyperion from the ''Exiles'' series (see below), was a part of the reality hopping team known as Weapon X. This version of Hyperion is far more powerful than his other incarnations. He seeks to conquer alternate Earths with the aid of alternate versions of [[Spider-Man]] and [[Ms. Marvel]] and in the process kills alternate versions of [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]], The Hulk, Wolverine, Thor, [[Namora]], and others. He was eventually defeated by Blink and an alternate version of Gambit who used creative tactics to beat him.{{issue|date=August 2014}} But Hyperion survived even though his body was blown to pieces and he was able to regenerate and regain his full power. After which he seeks revenge on the Exiles only to be engaged in battle by two alternate versions of himself, including the Earth-712 version.{{issue|date=August 2014}} After which, King Hyperion is exiled to his home reality where Earth was completely destroyed by nuclear weapons in an attempt to destroy King Hyperion years before.{{issue|date=August 2014}} He somehow escapes from Earth-4023 and is later seen in Russia in the regular Marvel Universe battling the [[Winter Guard]] and the [[Blue Marvel (Marvel Comics)|Blue Marvel]], the latter of which manages to defeat him.<ref>''[[Age of Heroes (comics)|Age of Heroes]]'' #3 (Sept. 2010). Marvel Comics.</ref> After imprisonment in the Raft he was nominated for the Thunderbolts program by [[Luke Cage]].<ref>''Thunderbolts ''#151 (Feb. 2011). Marvel Comics.</ref> King Hyperion tells the team he is the heroic version, and that the Hyperion who fought Blue Marvel had switched their places upon defeat. This turns out to be a lie, and he turns on the Thunderbolts during their first mission together.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #152</ref> After briefly battling Juggernaut, he is brought down by Ghost, who uses the nanites in King Hyperion's spine to dose him with Argonite. Moonstone, Juggernaut and Man Thing savagely beat the weakened King Hyperion.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #153 (Apr. 2011). Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Zombie Hyperion (Earth-616)===
Another Hyperion appeared on Earth-616 as a member of the Zombie Squadron Supreme. Like his teammates, this Hyperion is a zombified clone of the hero of Earth-712 and is created by scientists who are attempting to give Earth its own Squadron Supreme. They graft the DNA of the Earth-712 team (allegedly obtained the last time the team crossed into Earth-616) to corpses of normal humans and zap them with space radiation known as the Z-wave. This animates the super-powered team to life, but with the unforeseen consequence that they are flesh-craving zombies. Believing themselves to be the original Squadron Supreme and with no memory of how they got into the underground lab facility, the team goes on a rampage before being quarantined, apparently carrying the same virus present in the majority of ''[[Marvel Zombies (series)|Marvel Zombies]]'' books. Hyperion is the only one to escape while his teammates stay behind to try to escape their own way. He goes on an eating frenzy in the surrounding Kansas countryside before dying of Mad Cow disease which he contracted while eating a group of cattle.<ref>''Marvel Zombies Supreme'' #1-2. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Hyperion (Earth-13034)===
Another Hyperion joins the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] in [[Jonathan Hickman]]'s ''The Avengers'' vol. 5, #1 (December 2012). Hickman described the decision to use a new Hyperion, rather than an existing one:
<blockquote>"This is yet another parallel universe Hyperion. This is not King Hyperion, or Supreme Power Hyperion, this is not Gruenwald's Hyperion. This is Hyperion without all that baggage. This is Hyperion with a fresh slate, for a very specific purpose. He comes out of what the big story is behind the whole Avengers three-year plan that I have. He's very important, very pivotal, and I think people are really going to dig where we go with that. He's not going to be our poor analogue for Superman."<ref name="HickmanAvengers">{{Cite web |last=Ching |first=Albert |title=Jonathan Hickman Brings the World to Marvel NOW! AVENGERS |url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/jonathan-hickman-marvel-now-avengers.html |publisher=[[Newsarama]] |date=December 5, 2012 |accessdate=December 8, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6ClMMUMZ6?url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/jonathan-hickman-marvel-now-avengers.html |archivedate=December 8, 2012 |deadurl=no |df= }}</ref></blockquote>

His origin is that he came to Earth as a baby sent as the only survivor of a race of Eternals from a dying world. He was raised by a man named "Father", who named him Marcus Milton and taught him the morals of society. As an adult, he became the superhero named Hyperion and protected the world alongside the Squadron Supreme. When his reality collided with another reality, Hyperion was the only survivor, floating around in the void that used to be his reality until a group of [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]] scientists pulled him into the Earth-616 reality. Hyperion was in the captivity of A.I.M. until he was freed by the Avengers and offered a place amongst them.<ref name="Avengers #4">''Avengers'' Vol. 4 #4</ref> Hyperion is among the superheroes that joined the Avengers due to the threat of [[Ex Nihilo (comics)|Ex Nihilo]] on Mars.<ref>''Avengers'' Vol. 4 #2</ref> Hyperion was with the Avengers when A.I.M. was sighted in the [[Savage Land]] trying to extract the formula from one of the Garden's evolution pods.<ref name="Avengers #4"/> Hyperion later joins the Earth-616 version of the Squadron Supreme along with other various heroes who survived their home realities' destruction. This new incarnation of the Squadron Supreme are more dangerous than the Earth-712 and Supreme Power versions as they swear to protect Earth by any means necessary.{{issue|date=May 2016}} Their first public battle is the destruction of Atlantis which Hyperion enacts himself as well as severing [[Namor]]'s head with his atomic vision, killing him instantly in retaliation for the King of Atlantis' role in the annilation of Doctor Spectrum's home reality.{{issue|date=May 2016}} After the public death of Namor the Squadron Supreme become a very controversial team which puts them at odds with the Avengers.{{issue|date=May 2016}} Hyperion is convinced to take on a secret identity and later decides to take a job as truck driver.{{issue|date=May 2016}}

===Baron Hyperion (Secret Wars 2015)===
Another version of Hyperion appears on Battleworld during ''Secret Wars'' in the four issue mini-series ''Squadron Sinister''. This Hyperion comes from an unknown Earth and resembles his 1960's incarnation except that he wears long pants. Baron Hyperion's version of the Squadron Sinister consists of a Silver Age-styled Whizzer and Nighthawk but with modern-styled versions of Doctor Spectrum, who is Japanese and Warrior Woman, who appears to be a light-skinned African-American. Baron Hyperion appears to be more powerful than most of his other alternate incarnations and rules the province of Utopolis and frequently conquers and annexes other provinces. The Squadron Sinister easily defeats and kills their counterparts from another reality, Baron Hyperion effortlessly incinerating the other Hyperion, save for their version of Nighthawk, who is forced to act as the Sinister's regent. Baron Hyperion is arrogant and bloodthirsty and prefers to kill his opponents with his atomic vision. Nighthawk gets fed up with Hyperion's pride and secretly plots to kill him. Warrior Woman, who is in a sexual relationship with Hyperion also plans to overthrow him. Nighthawk creates a plan for the Squadron to steal an Argonite gun from the Shadow Province, which succeeds.<ref>''Squadron Sinister'' #1 (2015)</ref> Days later the Squadron fight and defeat The Fearsome Four after they tried to conquer the province of Europix, which Hyperion warned them against earlier. During the battle with The Fearsome Four in Europix the Argonite gun is stolen from the Squadron's headquarters.<ref>''Squadron Sinister'' #2 (2015)</ref> Nighthawk and Whizzer later recover the Argonite gun from Sandman who is revealed to have stolen it. Later Nighthawk frames Whizzer for the theft of the Argonite gun and Hyperion incinerates him. Sometime after, Nighthawk manipulates Doctor Spectrum into fleeing after a Thor Corp member is found dead (secretly murdered by Nighthawk) and Spectrum is the prime suspect. Warrior Woman secretly leads the heroes of Nutopia to invade Utopolis, all the while pretending to be sided with the Squadron. Hyperion is first caught off guard by the Nutopians but he eventually kills their heavy-hitters with ease, forcing them to retreat.<ref>''Squadron Sinister'' #3 (2015)</ref> Afterwards, Warrior Woman disappears which angers Hyperion to the point of destroying buildings and killing civilians. Nighthawk appears and shoots Hyperion in the back with the Argonite gun. Nighthawk reveals that he has obtained Doctor Spectrum's Power Prism and he engages in an equally matched battle with Hyperion. But Hyperion soon starts to weaken due to Argonite exposure and Nighthawk gets the upper hand. Eventually Hyperion weakens enough that Nighthawk disregards the Power Prism and strangles Hyperion to death with his bare hands, breaking his neck in the process.<ref>''Squadron Sinister'' #4 (2015)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
All versions of Hyperion possess superhuman strength, stamina, speed, [[wikt: durability|durability]], flight, and in a few cases powerful breath. Each also has greatly enhanced sensory perceptions, which extends to being able to perceive the entire [[electromagnetic spectrum]] (IR, UV vision; radio hearing and radar){{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} and "atomic vision" - the equivalent of [[List of superhuman features and abilities in fiction#Energy blasts|x-ray vision]]. The heroic Earth-712 version of Hyperion also possesses the ability to use [[cosmic energy]] to augment his life force granting him great longevity and regenerative abilities, courtesy of his Eternal heritage. King Hyperion has vast healing abilities and can regenerate even when his body is blown apart, given a sufficient amount of time. Most of the versions of Hyperion's powers and vitality are diminished when exposed to [[argonite]] [[radiation]]. The Earth-712 Hyperion also has a [[college degree]] in [[journalism]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

==Other versions==
In the [[Earth-9997]] universe seen in the miniseries ''[[Paradise X]]'', a version of Hyperion is recruited by the robot [[Machine Man|X-51]] for his squadron of interdimensional heralds. He stems from a world in which almost all superheroes perished in a nuclear attack by the governments of Earth, leaving him as the only survivor. This Hyperion kills the master villain [[Kulan Gath]] who is responsible for the deaths of many of Earth's heroes on yet another alternate world.<ref>''Heralds'' #1-3 and ''[[Paradise X]]'' #0 - 12 (April - 2002 - August 2003). Marvel Comics.</ref>

The alternate universe title ''[[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]]'' features a version of Hyperion referred to as "King Hyperion", who is a member of a team known as [[Weapon X (Exiles)|Weapon X]]. Although initially aiding the team to travel between dimensions to repair the time/space continuum, the character is revealed to be [[psychopathic]] and commits mass [[genocide]] on several worlds before finally being stopped and banished to his original dimension.<ref>''Exiles'' #38 - 40 (February - April 2004); 63 - 65 (June - August 2005). Marvel Comics.</ref> However, King Hyperion somehow escaped this dimension and found his way to Earth 616, where he battled and was defeated by the [[Blue Marvel (Marvel Comics)|Blue Marvel]].<ref>''Age of Heroes'' #3.

===Television===
*Hyperion (alongside the Squadron Supreme) appears in ''[[The Super Hero Squad Show]]'', voiced by [[Travis Willingham]].<ref>http://www.comicscontinuum.com/stories/1004/23/index.htm</ref> In the episode "Whom Continuity Would Destroy!", he alongside Nighthawk and [[Power Princess]] are pulled from their reality by the [[Grandmaster (Marvel Comics)|Grandmaster]] in order to fight Iron Man, the Hulk and [[Scarlet Witch]]. Hyperion ended up fighting Hulk in Egypt and lost because of allegedly 'held back'.
*Hyperion appears in the ''[[Avengers Assemble (TV series)|Avengers Assemble]]'' animated series,<ref>http://www.dailymarvelite.com/hyperion-set-to-appear-in-marvels-avengers-assemble/</ref> voiced by [[Brian Bloom]].<ref name="Hyperion">{{cite episode|title=Hyperion|serieslink=Avengers Assemble (TV series)|series=Avengers Assemble|network=Disney XD|season=1|number=7|airdate=August 4, 2013}}</ref> This version is an alien from another planet who attempted to end corruption with his team. However, their ways of ending corruption involved enslaving their own people in an effort to create order. When the people of the planet refused to blindly obey them, they used the Power Prism to destroy the planet, leaving Hyperion to search for another planet to inhabit.

: Introduced in season one, he first appears in his self-titled episode "Hyperion" when the Avengers attempt to stop a cluster of planet-sized meteorites from striking the East Coast. First saving Manhattan from a meteor classified by [[Edwin Jarvis|J.A.R.V.I.S.]] as an 'Earth-Killer' and when crashing the Avengers' battle with [[Wrecker (comics)|Wrecker]], Hyperion introduces himself to the Avengers when they encounter him in his citadel above the city. Though Hyperion orders his computer Quagmire to show his origin story, he leaves out the part where he enslaved his people, and claimed that his home world's destruction was the population's own fault. When he tried to kill Wrecker on the Golden Gate Bridge as he was trying to escape, the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] stood in his way, believing that killing the bad guys was against the law. In a fit of rage, Hyperion fought the Avengers. While the other Avengers fought him, Iron Man used J.A.R.V.I.S. to hack the citadel's computer and found out about what Hyperion left out when he told the Avengers his origin, confirming that Hyperion was insane. Though defeated by the Avengers and placed in a special cell stating, Hyperion is later freed by the [[Red Skull|Iron Skull]] while offered a membership in the [[Cabal (comics)|Cabal]] at the end of "Bring on the Bad Guys". In the episodes "The Ambassador" and "By the Numbers", Hyperion serves as a member of the Cabal while having the chance to take revenge on the Avengers, taking on either [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] or the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]]. But in the events of episodes "Exodus" and "The Final Showdown", he saved by Iron Man when almost is killed by Iron Skull's trap, to which Hyperion and the other Cabal members aid the Avengers in defeating Red Skull.

: Season two revealed that Hyperion's team did not perish. In the episode "Nighthawk", Nighthawk appeared on Earth and mentioned about knowing of Hyperion's time with the Cabal and considered him the 'hammer' of the group. Hyperion later appears on the [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] Tri-Carrier and frees Nighthawk with the intent to reform their group. In the episode "The Dark Avengers", the [[Squadron Supreme]] have become Earth's guardians thanks to the power of the Reality Stone with Hyperion as leader and the Avengers are wanted felons. Hyperion attempts to use his super-breath to incapacitate the heroes.
