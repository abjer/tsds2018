'''Alexander "Alex" Power''' (also known as '''Zero-G''') is a [[fictional character]] in [[Marvel Comics]]. 

==Publication history==
He first appeared in ''[[Power Pack]]'' #1 and was created by [[Louise Simonson]] and [[June Brigman]].

When Alex was introduced in ''Power Pack'' #1, he took the name Gee after attaining gravity-manipulating powers. He swapped powers with his sister [[Katie Power|Katie]] in issue 25, after which Alex took the name Destroyer until issue 52, when he obtained his brother [[Jack Power|Jack]]'s power to manipulate his own mass and took the name Mass Master from that point until ''Power Pack'''s cancellation with issue 62 (it is later established<ref>''Power Pack Holiday Special'' (1992)</ref> that Alex was replaced with a [[doppelgänger]] at some indeterminate point after becoming Mass Master). In the ''Power Pack Holiday Special'', he regained his original gravity-manipulating powers and nickname, and presumably continued under this pseudonym until he resurfaced in ''[[New Warriors]]'' issues 47-51, in a storyline written by former ''Power Pack'' editor [[Fabian Nicieza]] which saw Alex steal his siblings' powers for himself and adopt the name Power Pax.  Continuing as a periphery cast member of the New Warriors, he sporadically appeared in their adventures (see bibliography at bottom of page for relevant issues) and renamed himself Powerhouse before deciding - after blaming himself for the destruction of his family's sentient starship [[Smartship Friday|Friday]] - to rejoin Power Pack and return their powers to them.  Resurfacing with the rest of his family in a 4-issue miniseries published in 2000, Alex had taken the name Zero-G at some point during the team's 4-year publishing hiatus, and also created a new costume.  With the end of that miniseries, Alex was not seen again until he appeared on the cover of ''[[Avengers: The Initiative]]'' #1 (in his Zero-G costume) as one of 150 Marvel superheroes either involved with, or being considered as potential recruits by the [[Fifty State Initiative]].  He appeared in ''[[Civil War (comic book)|Civil War: Battle Damage Report]]'' as a potential recruit (named as Powerhouse, not Zero-G - possibly having changed his name once again).  It is stated by his sister [[Julie Power|Julie]] that she was speaking to him on the phone during a scene in ''[[Loners]]'' #1, but he is not seen or heard.  He appeared in ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' #574, where he was a guest of Franklin Richards' birthday party. He next appears as a member of the [[Future Foundation]], which was created by [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]].<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #579</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
Alex Power was born in [[Richmond, Virginia]]. When Alex is twelve, he and his siblings gain superpowers from a sentient spaceship named Friday and form the [[Power Pack]].<ref>''Power Pack'' #1 (May 1984)</ref> Alex acts as their leader, but his temper sometimes causes them trouble.<ref>''Power Pack'' (vol. 1) #22</ref>

He later steals his siblings' powers and becomes a reserve member of the [[New Warriors]] as [[Powerhouse (comics)|Powerhouse]].<ref>''New Warriors'' #47</ref> He eventually leaves the New Warriors and returns to Power Pack.<ref>''New Warriors'' vol 2 #1 (1999)</ref>

After the [[Civil War (comics)|superhuman civil war]], Alex is one of the 142 registered superheroes who are a part of the [[Fifty State Initiative]],<ref>''[[Avengers: The Initiative]]'' #1</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marvel.com/news/comicstories.947 |title=Avengers: The Initiative #1 Character Map |publisher=Marvel.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120526061017/http://www.marvel.com/news/comicstories.947 |archivedate=2012-05-26 }}</ref> and trains at [[Camp Hammond (comics)|Camp Hammond]].<ref>{{Comic book reference | Writer =[[Anthony Flamini]] & Ronald Byrd | Penciller =  | Inker =  | Story =  | Title = [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War Battle Damage Report]] | Issue =  |date= March 2007 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref>

When Alex is 19, he joins Reed Richards' [[Future Foundation]],<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #574</ref> a group of gifted children including [[Valeria Richards]], [[Artie Maddicks]], Bentley Whitman (a young clone of [[Wizard (Marvel Comics)|The Wizard]]), [[Dragon Man]], and children from both the Moloids' Underground City and an older Atlantean City.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #579</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Alex's original power was control over gravity. His original codename was "Gee", as in G-Forces. He first used this power to make himself stick to Friday to avoid being pulled into the Snarks' starship,<ref>''Power Pack'' (vol. 1) #1</ref> and he quickly learned he could use it to cancel his own gravity and that of other objects. Alex' ability to cancel gravity was unlimited. However, he also had to deal with the inertia of the objects he lifted. Though Alex could float by negating gravity, he had no means of self-propulsion, and thus could not truly fly. He initially depended on his sister Julie to push him along before developing an alternate method.

After having his gravity powers forcibly removed by Jakal,<ref>''Power Pack'' (vol. 1) #24-25</ref> Alex received the energy powers previously held by Katie.<ref>''Power Pack'' (vol. 1) #25</ref> He renamed himself Destroyer,<ref>''Power Pack'' (vol. 1) #27</ref> but found himself struggling with the moral issues his new power's lethal potential raised. Alex also pushed the upper limits of the energy power's capacity for absorption; in a battle with the [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinel]] [[Master Mold]], he disintegrated almost the entire bulk of the multi-story [[robot]]'s body, causing his body to swell with stored energy. In the process, Alex found that exceeding his normal absorption limits generated intense pain, impaired his ability to think clearly, and made it difficult to release the stored energy.<ref>''Power Pack'' (vol. 1) #36</ref>

After a third power switch, he received the density powers previously held by Jack and Julie and took on Jack's former identity as Mass Master.<ref>''Power Pack'' (vol. 1) #52</ref> Alex was the first Power sibling to use the powers to turn himself into a liquid state.<ref>''Power Pack'' (vol. 1) #55</ref>

Alex underwent a transformation into an actual Kymellian, which started with mild hair loss.<ref>''Power Pack'' (vol. 1) #56- 62</ref> It was eventually revealed that Alex had learned of his parents' kidnapping and had been kidnapped himself by Queen Maraud and a Kymellian Technocrat and was replaced by a clone which reverted to its original Kymellian form. The real Alex then escaped from captivity in Maraud's ship and rejoined his siblings.<ref>''Power Pack Holiday Special''</ref>

Alex wears a costume of [[unstable molecules]] created by Friday. The costume exists in an extra-dimensional space known as "Elsewhere" until summoned by voice command (the wearer would say the words "costume on!"). The costume also houses a communicator which is used to communicate with Friday, and was later modified to include a mask.<ref>''Power Pack'' (Vol.2)</ref>  As with all the team's costumes, the pockets of the costume can be used as an access point to Elsewhere itself, where the cartoon-like creatures known simply as "The Tailors" reside in a colorful wonderland of talking dinosaurs, enchanted forests, mad monarchs, surreal architecture, and malleable physical laws.<ref>''Power Pack'' #47</ref>

During his first stint with his gravity powers, Alex also wore a set of wings which he designed himself after learning more about the effects of gravity and inertia in school.<ref>''Power Pack'' (vol. 1) #14</ref> The wings, which were sewn by Julie and attached to his costume with straps, allowed him to propel himself and "fly" through clever manipulation of gravity and occasional use of air currents, instead of relying on Lightspeed to carry him.  Alex passed the wings on when Jack acquired the gravity power, but they were destroyed almost immediately, during Power Pack's subsequent encounter with the [[Marauders (comics)|Marauders]] during the [[Mutant Massacre]].<ref>''Power Pack'' (vol. 1) #27</ref>

==Other versions==

===All ages miniseries===
Alex appears in the ''Power Pack'' all ages miniseries line. He is similar in age and appearance to the version of the character as seen in ''Power Pack'' Vol. 1, though he is portrayed as not needing to make physical contact with something to negate its gravity, often doing so from a distance - in the original ''Power Pack'' series, he can only affect objects by physical contact. His sometimes antagonistic relationship with younger sister Katie is also absent, with Alex pointedly nurturing his younger sister through her difficulties in hiding the family's powers from their parents.<ref>''Power Pack'' Vol. 3 (collected as ''Power Pack: Pack Attack'') #1</ref>

===Avengers and Power Pack Assemble!===
Within the third and fourth issues of ''Avengers and Power Pack Assemble!'' miniseries, the Power Pack were thrown ten years into the future and met older versions of themselves, including a 25-year-old Alex Power. In those issues he shows greater control over his powers, (such as being able to deconstruct an enemy powered-armor suit), and now wields [[Captain America|Captain America's]] shield.

===House of M===
Alex appears as a member of [[Wolfpack (Marvel Comics)|Wolfpack]], based in the Bronx.<ref>''House of M: Avengers'' #3</ref>

===Marvel Zombies===
Alex, alongside the rest of Power Pack, appear as zombies in the pages of ''[[Marvel Zombies vs. The Army of Darkness]]'' #3.  They are attacked by [[Nextwave]], whom the Pack murder off-panel in an allegedly graphic fashion.<ref>''[[Marvel Zombies vs. The Army of Darkness]]'' #3</ref>

===Millennial Visions===
In the "Power Pack: Starting Over" story within Marvel's 2001 ''Millennial Visions'' alternate universe one-shot comic, Alex was depicted as a 32-year-old construction foreman who had retired from superheroing to raise a family.<ref>''Millennial Visions'' Marvel, 2001</ref>

===X-Force===
A young girl called Francine Power appeared under the name PowerPax in ''[[X-Force]] Annual'' #1, as part of a story set years in the future of the Marvel Universe. This PowerPax not only utilized the collective powers of Power Pack, but wore the same costume Alex would be seen wearing when he took the collective powers of Power Pack for himself and operated as a superhero also called PowerPax.  The X-Force Annual came several years before Alex' tenure as a featured cast member of the New Warriors, but both were written by ''Power Pack'' editor [[Fabian Nicieza]].<ref>''X-Force Annual'' #1</ref>
