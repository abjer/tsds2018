'''Baymax''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[superhero]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Created by [[Steven T. Seagle]] and [[Duncan Rouleau]], Baymax first appeared in ''Sunfire & Big Hero 6'' #1 (September [[1998 in comics|1998]]). Baymax begins his existence as [[Hiro Takachiho]]'s science project. Originally designed to be a hydro-powered robotic synthformer programmed to serve as Hiro's personal bodyguard, butler, and chauffeur, Baymax becomes Hiro's best friend and father figure when the young inventor programs his recently deceased father's brain engrams into Baymax's artificial intelligence. When the Giri recruits Hiro into the fledgling super-team [[Big Hero 6 (comics)|Big Hero 6]], Baymax also joins the team, where his phenomenal strength, and amazing surveillance and data analysis capabilities have proven useful.

Baymax is an artificial synthformer capable of synthtransing his body into various forms: a large humanoid male, "Battle-Dragon" and "Action-Mecha". The first serves as his default form, designed to be less conspicuous in public while attending to Hiro's daily needs. His other forms, significantly more powerful and imposing, are primarily used during undercover missions and other hostile operations. In all forms, Baymax has internal scanners and sensors able to detect and evaluate threats posed by nearby lifeforms. He is also programmed with fighting techniques from forms of combat including [[karate]], [[tae kwon do]], [[Western boxing]] and [[Wing Chun]].

Baymax appears in the 2014 [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney animated]] film ''[[Big Hero 6 (film)|Big Hero 6]]'', voiced by [[Scott Adsit]], and in the videogame ''[[Disney Infinity: Marvel Super Heroes]]''. He is depicted as an inflatable robot built by Tadashi, the older brother of the protagonist Hiro Hamada, to serve as a healthcare companion.

==Publication history==
Created by [[Steven T. Seagle]] and [[Duncan Rouleau]] in their spare time while working on another project, Baymax was first intended to appear with the rest of [[Big Hero 6 (comics)|Big Hero 6]] in ''[[Alpha Flight (comic book)|Alpha Flight]]'' #17 (December 1998). However, the team first appeared in their own self-titled three-issue miniseries by writer [[Scott Lobdell]] and artist Gus Vasquez, which due to scheduling issues, was published before ''Alpha Flight'' #17.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.laughingplace.com/w/blogs/fanboy/2014/03/25/movie-week-a-look-ahead-to-big-hero-6/|title=LaughingPlace.com » Movie Week: A Look Ahead To Big Hero 6|publisher=|accessdate=23 October 2014}}</ref><ref>Palmeri, Christopher (November 3, 2014).

==Fictional character biography==
Monster Baymax began his existence as a science project created by [[Hiro Takachiho|Hiro]]. He was originally designed to be a hydro-powered robotic synthformer programmed to serve as Hiro's personal bodyguard, butler, and chauffeur. However, prior to the project's completion, Hiro's father died and the young inventor programmed Baymax's artificial intelligence using the brain engrams of his recently departed father. With the thoughts and emotions of Hiro's father, Baymax became much more than a robotic bodyguard. He also functions as Hiro's best friend and father figure, and is by his side nearly every hour of every day. Baymax also feels a deep attachment to Hiro's mother; however, Hiro and Baymax decided it was not in her best interest to inform her that her departed husband's memories were used as the basis for Baymax's artificial intelligence, at least for the time being.<ref name="Hero #1">''Big Hero 6'' #1 (2008)</ref>

Baymax is programmed to serve and protect Hiro and therefore unable to allow his creator to be placed in possibly dangerous situations. When the Giri attempted to recruit Hiro into the fledgling super-team known as [[Big Hero 6 (comics)|Big Hero 6]], Baymax was also on their list of potential operatives. Baymax opposed the idea of Hiro being placed in harm's way but acquiesced to joining the team after the Everwraith, the astral embodiment of those killed in the 1945 nuclear attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, abducted Hiro's mother. Baymax continues to serve alongside Hiro on Big Hero 6, where his phenomenal strength, and amazing surveillance and data analysis capabilities have proven very useful.<ref name="Hero #1"/>

==Powers and abilities==
Baymax is an artificial synthformer capable of synthtransing his body into various forms. His default form is a large humanoid male designed to be less conspicuous in public while attending to Hiro's daily needs. His other forms "Battle-Dragon" and "Action-Mecha", are significantly more powerful and imposing than his default humanoid form, and are primarily used during undercover missions and other hostile operations. When Baymax sustains physical injuries beyond his damage threshold, he automatically reverts to his humanoid form and becomes temporarily depowered.<ref name="Hero #1"/>

In all forms, Baymax is equipped with internal scanners and sensors able to detect and evaluate the threat posed by lifeforms in the immediate vicinity. He can also deploy remote monitors to record events from afar. His feet are equipped with jet engines capable of generating a thrust sufficient to propel him at speeds up to Mach 4. He can send, receive, and intercept radio transmissions, and monitors all networks maintained by the Japanese Ministry of Defense. Baymax is also directly linked to Hiro's personal Core Cyber-Network (CCN). As a result, when Baymax is not in Hiro's vicinity, he can be immediately summoned via a communication device mounted on Hiro's wrist. Baymax is also connected to Hiro's cybernetic glasses, so that everything that Hiro sees and hears while wearing the glasses is stored in Baymax's databanks for later reference and analysis.<ref name="Hero #1"/>

Baymax is programmed with fighting techniques from several forms of combat, including karate, tae kwon do, Western boxing, and Wing Chun. He possesses a durable, polymantium endo/exoskeleton resistant to most forms of small ballistics. Baymax uses water as his primary source of power for locomotion. His artificial intelligence system is memory-card-based and contains thoughts and emotions of Hiro's departed father, industrialist Tomeo Takachiho.<ref name="Hero #1"/>

Co-director Don Hall said "Baymax views the world from one perspective—he just wants to help people, he sees Hiro as his patient." Producer Roy Conli said "The fact that his character is a robot limits how you can emote, but Scott was hilarious. He took those boundaries and was able to shape the language in a way that makes you feel Baymax’s emotion and sense of humor.
