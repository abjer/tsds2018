'''Kid Colt''' (real name: Blaine Colt, but see below) is an [[United States|American]] [[American frontier|Old West]] [[cowboy]] character who starred in the [[comic book]] series ''Kid Colt Outlaw'', as well as in several other titles. He is the longest-running cowboy star in American comic-book publishing, featured in stories for a 31-year stretch from 1948–1979, though from 1966 most of the published stories were reprints. A brief publishing hiatus occurred between issues #139 (April 1968) and #140 (Oct. 1969).

Some of Kid Colt's earliest adventures, beginning with ''Kid Colt Outlaw'' #14 (May 1951) were written and drawn by [[Pete Tumlinson]]. Artist [[Jack Keller (comics)|Jack Keller]] began his long association with the character starting with ''Kid Colt, Outlaw'' #25 (March 1953). Marvel editor [[Stan Lee]] would later take over writing chores on the title. Cover artists included such notables as [[Joe Maneely]], [[John Severin]], and [[Russ Heath]], until the frequent Marvel cover team of penciller [[Jack Kirby]] and inker [[Dick Ayers]] took over for the bulk of them from 1959-1965.

Kid Colt and his horse Steel [[first appeared]] in ''Kid Colt'' #1 (August 1948), from Marvel predecessor [[Timely Comics]]. Originally his cover logo was subtitled "''Hero of the West''" but by issue three this was changed to "''Outlaw''". His origin, as told in ''Kid Colt'' #11 (Sept. 1950), involved Colt being wrongly accused of murder (he killed his father's murderer in a fair gun battle) and becoming a fugitive from the law, along the way engaging in heroic good acts in an effort to restore his reputation. This origin is similar to that of the [[Rawhide Kid]], another Western character from Marvel's 1950s iteration, [[Atlas Comics (1950s)|Atlas Comics]].

Kid Colt appeared in numerous series through that decade, including ''[[All Winners Comics|All Western Winners]]''<!--sp OK-->, ''[[Wild Western]]'', ''Two-Gun Western'',<!--sp OK--> and ''[[Gunsmoke Western]]''. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, he appeared in the reprint title ''[[The Mighty Marvel Western]]'' along with the [[Two-Gun Kid]] and the Rawhide Kid; he additionally headlined the three-issue ''Giant-Size Kid Colt'' reprint series. His signature series ended with #229 (April 1979), making it the longest-running Western comic book. <ref>[https://www.webcitation.org/mainframe.php "''Kid Colt, Outlaw'' in Don Markstein's Toonopedia, archived by Webcitation.org, Retrieved January 4, 2017]</ref> 

The character has appeared sporadically in [[Marvel universe]] [[superhero]] titles, usually in stories involving [[time travel]] between the current era and Western times. These have included ''[[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]]'' #141-43 (1975), ''[[The Fantastic Four]]'' vol. 3, #33-34 (2000) and ''[[Black Panther (comics)|The Black Panther]]'' vol. 3, #46-47 (2002).

It was not until 2000, with the [[miniseries]] ''[[Blaze of Glory (comics)|Blaze of Glory]]'', by writer [[John Ostrander]] and artist [[Leonardo Manco]], that a Western series again featured Kid Colt. The gritty miniseries — which featured different-looking versions of Marvel Western characters and [[retcon]]ned that the naively clean-cut Marvel Western stories of years past were merely [[dime novel]] fictions of their actual lives — killed off Kid Colt in the series' conclusion (#4, March 2000). An older version of Kid Colt appears in 'Skaar: King Of The Savage Land'', having faked his death and subsequently time-traveling.<ref>''Skaar: King of the Savage Land'' #2-4 (2011)</ref>

Marvel reintroduced Kid Colt as teenager in a 2009 "One-Shot" comic ("Kill the Kid") written by Tom Defalco and illustrated by Rick Burchett (originally published in digital format). The book, narrated by a self-proclaimed drifter named Everett Hawkmore who partners with the Kid, retells a somewhat modified origin story and changes the title character's real name to Blaine Cole. Potential plot threads unrealized in the story include a brother of Cole missing after the raid that killed his parents and a search for a witness to the gunfight that had erroneously branded him an outlaw.<ref>''Kid Colt'' One-Shot, No. 1, September, 2009, Marvel Publishing, Inc., New York)</ref>

The character also appears in 2010's ''[[Rawhide Kid]]: The Sensational Seven''.

During a period where time itself was becoming unraveled, Kid Colt teamed up with the Hulk, Rawhide Kid and Two-Gun Kid to stop a murderous sheriff with time-traveling powers.<ref>''Indestructible Hulk'' #12 (October 2013)</ref>

'''Kid Colt''' (real name: Elric Freedom Whitemane) is a contemporary [[superhero]] character in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel universe|universe]] who has appeared as a member of the modern-day [[Young Allies]]. Created by [[Fabian Nicieza]] and [[Mark Bagley]], he debuted in ''[[Heroes Reborn (comics)|Heroes Reborn]]: Young Allies'' #1 (Jan. 2000).

Born to hippies, Elric was a normal child, until government agents paid his parents to let them give him special "tests" (which were attempts to fuse his [[DNA]] with the DNA of the equine aliens known as the [[Kymellian]]s). The tests were successful, and young Elric changed into a strange, bipedal horse-like creature. Hearing stories of the wild west, Elric assumed the identity of Kid Colt, and began to use his newfound powers to help those in need. He was eventually recruited by the [[Young Allies]] to help them free two alien beings. Elric decided to remain with the team.{{issue|date=November 2011}}

Elric is a hybrid of human and [[Kymellian]]. Due to his [[Extraterrestrial life in popular culture|alien]] [[DNA]], he can [[shapeshift]] into a humanoid horse, and [[Teleportation|teleport]] short distances. He can store items in sub-space "closets", pockets of extra-dimensional space which can hold items as large as a human being until Elric needs them. By creating multiple pockets which are linked together, Elric can run through them, and seem to rapidly blink in-and-out of existence. When he is not in his horse form, Elric wears a cowboy-themed costume in homage to the original Kid Colt. Due to his horse-like digestive system, Elric is a [[vegetarian]] (but still loves a good bowl of ice cream).{{issue|date=November 2011}}
