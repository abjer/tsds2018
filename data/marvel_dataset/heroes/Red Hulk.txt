===Robert Maverick===
The origin of the second Red Hulk is given in the 2017 debut issue of ''[[U.S.Avengers]]''. [[Four-star General]] '''[[Robert Maverick]]''' is selected for his genetic profile to create a being who is "halfway to a hulk". A device created by [[Avengers Idea Mechanics]] (a legitimate technology company created from the remnants of the defunct supervillain organization [[Advanced Idea Mechanics]]) called the Hulk Plug-In is implanted in Maverick's wrist, which when triggered, turns him into a variation of the Red Hulk for one hour approximately every day and a half. Unlike the Thunderbolt Ross version of Red Hulk, Maverick retains his mustache in his Hulk form and wears his sunglasses. He joins the [[U.S.Avengers]].<ref>[[Ewing, Al]] (w), [[Medina, Paco]] (p), Vlasco, Juan (i). "$kullocracy", ''U.S.Avengers'' #1 (March 2017). Marvel Comics.</ref>
