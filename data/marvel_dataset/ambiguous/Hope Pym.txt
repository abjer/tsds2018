==Publication history==
{{expand section|date=July 2016}}
Created by [[Tom DeFalco]] and [[Ron Frenz]], she first appeared in ''[[A-Next]]'' #7 (April 1999).

==Fictional character biography==
After the deaths of their parents, Hope Pym and her twin brother [[Big Man (comics)|Big Man]] (Henry Pym Jr.) became outraged when people began referring to A-Next as the "next generation" of Avengers. Using their parents' fortune, the twins put together the supervillain [[Revengers]] team and gained access to the [[Avengers Mansion]] via their parents' security codes.<ref>''A-Next'' #7</ref> When they ambushed A-Next, Hope set about to torture [[Cassandra Lang]], feeling that she's the Avengers' rightful heir. Hope was finally stopped when Henry prevented her from initiating the mansion's self-destruct sequence, which would have killed both A-Next and the Revengers.<ref>''A-Next'' #12</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
As Red Queen, she uses implanted bio-wings to fly. Also, she has bio-electric blasters installed on the gloves on the back of her hands, and extendable claws built into her gloves. However, she apparently does not have the ability to alter her size.{{issue|date=August 2015}}
